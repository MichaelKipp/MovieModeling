my partner...
detective eckhart!  i know!  welcome to nightmute!
you did your homework, officer.
actually...
just after leland street.
what is that, then?
eight years.
seven years.
yes, sir.
that is all, for now.
nice kid.
got a love affair with police work. drives me crazy with it.
so far.
what is the d.a. got them on?
four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
they are all over everybody.
i.a.'s calling themselves the "corruption task force."  can you believe that? trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other detectives may have made over the years.  they are turning it into a witch hunt.  something on the news about it practically every night.
that is i.a.'s pit bull.
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
guess that is what they call alaskan hospitality.
do not worry about him...
no.
no fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
like i said, no.  we know about those things up here.
he knew exactly what we would be looking for. made sure to cover up all his tracks.
even the best make mistakes.
your friend's all business.
I am always all business.
what do you want to talk about?
you know what about.
we will talk when we get back to seattle.
when is that, a week?  two weeks?...  we have to figure out a plan of action now.
you know my plan of action.
to do nothing.
that is right.
dammit, will.  warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>five</i> hours.  asking all kinds of questions...
he is asking everybody questions.
but he is zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  on <i>us</i>. everyone's talking about it.
he is just rattling your cage.
well, i got to tell you.  with a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it is rattling hard.
we say nothing.  it goes away.  simple as that.
weston dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  you remember that?
you know i remember that.
one word to i.a. and he walks.
maybe not.  we could talk to buck...
no way.
cut some kind of a deal.  i heard that is what flynn's doing...
mike flynn's a dirty cop, hap!  we are nothing like mike flynn.  we did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch dobbs paid for what he did.  and every bastard like him.  we say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they will all walk.  every last one.  and i am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  no deals.  no compromises.  no discussions.
do not give misdemeanors a bad rap.
but they are so boring.  all small stuff.
it is all about the small stuff.  small lies.  small mistakes.  small oversights. people give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  it is human nature.
typical seventeen year-old.  she went to a party friday night?
down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
she left the party early.  friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
what time was that?
around twelve-thirty.
who was the last one to see her alive?
randy stetz.  her boyfriend.  we have questioned him, searched his place. did not find anything.
well her mother did not buy them for her.
what are we thinking?
did you love her?
huh?
kay connell.  did you love her?
"she was nice."  wow.  that makes me all soft inside.  ever occur to you she did not love you back?
huh?
you heard me that time.
she loved me.  she wanted to see me every night.
but she was seeing someone else on the side.
i do not know what you are fucking talking about.
friday night, at the party - what did you fight about?
stuff.
what kind of stuff?
just stuff.  i do not fucking remember.
the other guy?
i told you i do not remember.
after that she left the party to go to him.
how should i know?...
ran like hell to go to him...
fuck you, man! - I am sick of all your fucking cop questions...
i do not know.
you do not know.
she did not tell me.
i want you to check this out, ellie.
we already did.
do it again.
but there was not any...
who is that?
the bartender at darrow's.  he was there friday night.
good.  he is up next.
looks like the natives are restless.
will?
i wish i could stick it out like you.  i just, with trish and the kids...
do not do this, hap...
I am thinking i could get off with probation.  keep half my pension.  that is all i want.
goddammit, hap.  think about what you are doing...
you do not have to be involved, will.
you tell buck and I am involved whether i like it or not...
we are sure it is hers?
has her books in it.
I will stick it in the evidence locker...
no.
this murder was in the papers, right?
yeah.  all over.
call all of them from here to anchorage. tell them we now know that kay connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we have not recovered it yet.  we can get it in by the morning editions.
what are you doing here?
i told her to come.
sorry about...
where is he?
and then i lost him.  in the fog.
about how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
will, you can not blame yourself.
i had him!
it is only going to make you crazy.
dormer.  still no sign of the bullet that went through farrell.
I am going to the hospital to talk to him now.  you get the search party together.  no fewer than thirty people.  I will meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  do not waste any time.
thanks.
i wish I would had the chance to get to know him better.  take him fishing or something.
he would have liked that.
we just gotta catch the bastard, right?
that is why I am here.  i need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, farrell.
what i saw?
anything.  it is important.
oh, you know.  do not feel that much. bullet went right through.
right.  got lost in the rocks.
we will get the other one, though.
i got it.  do not know why i bother.  it is been broken for two years.
habit.
fred duggar?
no.  he did not say what his name was. only that you were expecting him.
I am not expecting anyone.
that is not what he thinks.
what did he look like?
i could say the same thing about you.
oh.  we always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  it is the best time.
who is playing?
the puffins and the hawks.  we are in extra innings.  the hawks have a really good line-up this year.
she your only sibling?
twelve years younger.
oh, i should not have...
it is okay.  happened a long time ago.  he was killed in a fire.  in new mexico.
that must have been awful for you.
I am going back to the lodge, ellie. still need to go through some of kay connell's school records.
okay.
I will call him now.
first i need a copy of the key.
but here's the thing.  i retraced your exact steps according to your statement. you could not have seen detective eckhart from there.  i mean, not in that fog.
then change it.
how much closer would you say you were?
i do not remember.
five feet?  seven feet?
thought i smelled something.
good to see you, too, randy.
i never met anyone from seattle before.
you are not missing much.
what are you doing in this shit-hole town?
i was her best friend.
best friend?
since grade school.
that is a long time.
we were like sisters.  knew everything about each other.
must be tough for you.  what happened.
you want me to take you somewhere?
long as it is fun.
hey...
thought you wanted something fun...
you and kay were like sisters?
that is what i said.
told each other everything.  that why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
no...
who was kay seeing besides randy stetz?
i do not know.
you do not know.
she would not tell me!
but you were such good <i>friends...</i>
it was like some big fucking secret!
what was?
she kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  leave us all behind.  that <i>he</i> was going to take her!
who?
my arm!
who?
she used some stupid code name.
what was it?
brody...i do not know...  ...something brody!
forget your pager?
what?
i beeped you over two hours ago.
good.
and something else that might interest you.
no.
one of the paperbacks we found in kay connell's knapsack.
that is right.
mrs. connell found this copy in the house.  it is signed.  personally.
so?
this is a local writer.  kay had all his books.  i think we should check it out.
no game.
the phone call.  the knapsack.
I am sorry?
i said you are going to get a phone call.
oh?
kay connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
thought you might find that.
you are going to be brought in for questioning.
down at the station?
yes down at the station.
duggar called him?
about an hour ago.  said he was more than happy to cooperate.
not really.
is not that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  a good cop can not sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  a bad cop can not sleep 'cause his conscience will not let him.  you said that once, remember?
will...i...
what is it?
there is a guy down the hall.  complaining about the noise.  says he can not sleep.
one of your cases?
me and hap.  a year and a half ago.  i knew the second i met dobbs that he was guilty.  smug, cold.  dead eyes.  we had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  nothing concrete.  went over every inch of that apartment.
will.
there've been other cases.  where we have changed results.  pushed witnesses. manipulated evidence.  but dobbs.  i wanted dobbs more than anything.
what if someone finds out?
we are under investigation now.  back in seattle.  hap wanted to talk.  as soon as we got back.  thought he could work out some kind of deal.
where you signed this?
that is right.
what happened at that signing?
she flattered me about my writing.  asked if she could visit me.  to talk about my books.
did she?
yes.  not that much at first.  but then she became more comfortable.  started visiting me every week...
she was only seventeen.
but she was an attractive girl.
i suppose.
did you have sex with her?
no.
but you wanted to.
i was a mentor to her.
you gave her gifts.
yes.
expensive dresses.  a heart necklace.
yes.
does not sound like a mentor to me.
i gave her things she did not have. could not have.
she was not happy.  i was someone to talk to.
how do you mean?
that boyfriend.  randy.
randy stetz?
that is right.
what about him?
he.  well, he...
are you sure about that?
she would come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  i pled with her to let me call the police, but she would not hear it.  wanted to keep it a secret.
it is legitimate.
worth pursuing?
randy stetz is in jail.
told you i could write an ending.
congratulations.
i thought maybe we could talk some more.
there is nothing more to talk about.
but we work so well together...
what the hell do you know?
kay told me.  she comes to me, you know. tells me things.  about you.  about me.
i told you that was an accident!
then so was mine...
do not you pull that shit with me.
i did not want to kill her, will.
could not get it up, walter?
it was when i went to kiss her.  she started laughing.  i got angry.  after all I would given her.  all I would shared with her.  i just wanted to make her stop. that is all.
yes.  like that.
this an accident, walter?
if you want it to be...
i have to get back.
too bad...
did not want to miss anything.
detective dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
good.
maybe you could drive him to spencer's.
sure.
where is your back-up?
no back-up.
you are not following procedure.
procedure went out the window a long time ago.
wild card.
drop the gun, walter.
walter byrd killed kay connell.  her things are in the house.
i know.
byrd's dead.
no.  but i covered it up.  i lied.
why?
what about your shoulder?
do not worry.  I will have a cool scar.
