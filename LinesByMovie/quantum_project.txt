i've been dreaming about you.
day or night?
could we go somewhere?
i'm heading out of town.
okay.
what?
i could go out of town.
could you?
where to?
a place you've never been.
that's the physicist's playground.
why am i doing this?
it's an experiment.
we flopped the first time out.
at the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  they connect in unimaginable ways.
could be.
what universe are you in, paul?
a quantum one.
nothing is real until it's perceived.
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
how?
of what?
god.  i dunno.  the eternal nothingness. mia.
what did it want?
that's what it asked me.  "what do you want?"  i didn't answer.  i was in the middle of an experiment.
like now?
no.  i didn't.   i'm listening.
inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
she's in l.a., he's in the bay area --
a five hundred foot thick steel wall.  but the connection between these two electrons is so --
dysfunctional --
that they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
and glow happily ever after.
to isolation.  to an armed camp.  to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
you taking any medication?
don't waste it pauly.  this is not an everyday talk.  just input the information and ask relevant questions.  one: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
dad...
two: what if i didn't miss?
you did.
spare me your classical answer. measurements in.  results taken.  what if i didn't miss?
you did miss --
-- what if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  what then?   what did your life mean?  who did you nurture, pauly?  who did you love?
what was her name?
excuse me???
what was her name?  the one i met.
mia...?
yes....
i didn't want to leave things the way we did.  not this time.
wait.  i want to tell you something.
i've been dreaming about this.
then you get it.  you'll understand.
what?
why?
so i can move on.  you too.
