something wrong with the stairs?
avoid-all-contact-day.
what?
when dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it is avoid-all-contact-day.
t-t-thanks alice...
earth to alice...
rick, please.
alright, i think i see salvation...
do not you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
what?
the mirror.  you can not see yourself in it.
i do not want to.
yeah.  she would be half as strict as you.
but she would not let dad treat me like that.
look, you gotta stand up for yourself. learn to fight back.
rick...i can't.
never say can't.  just do what i do.
here you are.  where were you this morning?  rick's looking all over for you.
have you seen joey and kincaid!  god, i can not find them.  i can not find them anywhere.
I am sure they are around.
yeah, I am not so sure.
i love to dream, i just hate ones about my dad.
you could do worse.
my mom taught me when i was little.  did you ever hear of the dream master?
sounds like a game show host to me.
no really, it is a fable.  the 'guardian of good' dreams.  it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up.
great, you would not happen to know his phone number?
i daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  remember you are in control.
how did you learn so much about dreams?
when they are all you have, you kinda become an expert.
you what?
when i used to have nightmares.  i brought my friends in to help me.  until they all started dying.
what is it?
oh god!  he killed them!
feeling better now?
yeah.  i guess so... what happened?
you had a nasty bump.
i gotta get out of here.
you just stay put.  you need rest.
you do not get it, he is after me...
do not worry, honey
no...
you are his sister, right?
rick stayed later after school with kristen.  she was not feeling very well.
tell him i was looking for him, okay?  I am dan.
i know.  uh...alice.
you in a hurry?
i gotta get to the library before it closes.  killer physics test.
i know.  i hardly have any time to study.
maybe you should not be working here so much.  you do not want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
i know.
i think sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
give her time.  beauty is skin deep.
alice, you think you can leave?
what is wrong?
kincaid and joey died last night.
what?
hey, rick!
excuse me, ladies.  I will just be a moment.
kristen, what happened?
you will hear all kinds of stories. they will tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
now you know who and what freddy really is.
i though freddy was just an old town story.
it is no story.  it happened.  freddy's real and he is back.
I will tell you later.
it is no just a house. it is his home. he is waiting there for me...to dream.
it is okay, babe.  we are with you.
i told you you can not help.  this is not a normal nightmare. I am doomed.
i do not get it.
let me talk to you.
so what is up?  what did i miss?
she told us the story of freddy.  it is a town legend.  he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
so?
it pissed off a lot of parents. according to kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
nice neighborhood.
now it gets weird.  she says he comes back in dreams.  if he kills you there, you are dead for real.
something the matter with the cuisine?
well mom, I will tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
you are just tired.  do not think i have not noticed your not sleeping.  that has to stop, honey.
what is wrong with me?
your distraught.  it will help...
I am sorry honey, but...
sorry!! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who is now after me. in case you have not been keeping score, it is his fucking banquet, and I am the last course!!
honey, we went over this in therapy.
mother, you have just murdered me.  take that to your goddamn therapy...
you alright?
kristen...
hey man, we are all sorry...
she knew she was gonna die.
i thought it was an accident.  smoking in bed.
it was no suicide.  it was not an accident.  it was freddy, and he is coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
i was there in the dream.  he took her. it was awful.  it was awful...
"in her dream"?
ohhhhbaby, i am dead on my feet.
we have matching luggage.
what?
you have been up all night?
that obvious, huh?
then you saw him, too?
saw who? i was up all night cramming for this physics test, and i was putting this little baby together.  look...
asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  she was gonna be a doctor.
it was freddy.
enough of that crap.
i saw it. it was my dream.  i brought sheila in...
no, don't!  i gave sheila to him and now she is dead!
kristen's story really got to her.
i heard you screaming.  was it a bad one?
it was bad.
does not the dream master work for you anymore?
i can not find him.
hey, since when do you play thomas edison?  this looks like sheila's.
it is...was. it is a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
yeah, or turn you into toast.
i can not go back to sleep again.
i have not slept much either.  since kristen...
we will figure it out.
figure it out?!?!  I will be insane before i figure it out.  the only thing I am sure of is that i can not go to sleep.  not while he is using me.
then we will stay up together.
I have been working double shifts.
extra money, huh?
look, you know why, you just do not believe me.
no offense, or anything, but it is kind of hard to swallow.
the story is, the deaths you can not argue with.
how long have you been awake?
three days.
alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. why does freddy all of a sudden need you?
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy.  maybe freddy can not get to new kids without someone like me.  someone to bring them to him.
been up with alice.
how she doing?  i ran into her last night.
she is blaming herself for sheila.  i know how it feels.  I have been thinking about kristen.  maybe i could have stopped it, if I would listened.
about freddy?
what else?  you ever look over this town's history?  not a safe place to be a teenager.  anyway, if I am next, watch your back.
not really.
is there something we can do?
i do not think so.  i guess this is my own war.
you do not really get it.  he is not a nightstalker.  it will take more than bench presses to beat him.
why can not we just talk to the authorities?
yeah, right.  let's trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room.  adults will not see it. they can't.
then what else can we do?
try what other kids did.  keep each other awake.  we will meet at debbie's tonight. at least if we do not sleep he can not get us.
who?
he is going after debbie, i got to stop him.
hey, you are not alone.  we have to stop him, I am with you.
you just feel sorry for me.
cut that shit out.  maybe before, but not now. i want to help you. I am on your side.
as long as your driving does not kill us.
it is okay, we are just about there.
he is going after debbie.  i got to stop him.
you know, i get the weirdest feeling we have been through this before.
here we are.
something is wrong here.  it feels like...
what the hell was that?
debbie.  she is gone.  i've...collected her, like the others.
you look great!
save it for later.  come on!
