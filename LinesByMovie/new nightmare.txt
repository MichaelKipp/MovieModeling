might as well be, dylan.  state of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  bull tendons, nerve bundles from a doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
chase...
no.
you have a fever, sweetie?
just an earthquake, dylan.  every once in a while we get a few.
no biggie, really.
one of mom's cups got broken.
i'm sorry.  at least we're in on piece.
dylan, it's breakfast.  not arts and crafts  what?
you get any sleep last night?
more or less.  dylan, time to get dressed.  i'm late.
you going away?
just for a few hours.  julie'll be with you.
anything other than the obvious bothering you?
five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
hasn't been another call, has there?
maybe.  or maybe i shouldn't do this interview today.
you've got to get back on the horse some time.  look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  i know how scary that feels.
no, you don't.
okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
what if it isn't over?
maybe you should tell me your dream.
it was nothing.  we were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  terry and chuck were...hurt.  you were almost...  you were even cut.
you probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  dreams work like that.  you want me not to go on this job?
just be careful, okay?
i should survive two days in palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
guess so.
48 hours.  back before you know it.
someone's coming.
what?
yeah, julie, i'm sorry.  i just thought...there was an earthquake, i think.  little one, but...
big truck went right by before you opened the door.  life on the fault line.
heather, what is it?
dunno.  just have this feeling today...
studio b.
hi.  this is heather langenkamp.
the car's no there yet?
no.  i...listen, i can't make it in today.
you're kidding, right?
i'm sorry, i can't.
listen, dammit.
i just can't.
dylan, i gotta go.  forgive me?
bye.
i'll call the cops for you.  you've got the number on the fridge, right?
thanks.  just give them the time he called.  they're keeping a list, supposedly.  sorry.  my nerves are so raw these days.
's okay.
i don't know if it has, really.  with the exception of one and three, i've pretty much kept out of it.  i'm working in television now.  the hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
no, not really.  i...
do you let your child watch your movies?
my child?  no...but...
of course he is.  freddy's dead and gone.
and how about your co-star in nightmare i.  would you trust him alone with your child?
robert?  i...
maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  we've got a surprised, heather.  a great big surprise for you and our audience.
you okay?
i'm fine.
everything went great, i thought.  we really got you, didn't we?
i don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
in what, a romantic comedy?
just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
yes?
heather, this is sara risher over at new line.  how are you?
oh, hi.  i'm fine, sara.  my god, a voice from the past!
really!  listen, heather, i won't take but a minute of your time.  it's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. bob'd love to talk to you.
uh...sure...when?
no time like the present.  the car will bring you.
now?
just take a minute.  you'll be glad you did, i bet.
can i get you something to drink?
coffee'd be nice.
sounds good.  kim, would you get heather and me a coffee?  how you like it, hon?
black's fine.
me too.
i thought you'd killed freddy off.
we did.  bad mistake.  the fans are clamoring for more. so, evil never dies, right?  anyway, a while back we got a call from wes.  he's got this idea.  and who better to resurrect freddy than his creator?
i thought he'd stopped doing horror.
believe it or not, he told me i hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  they're his inspiration.  but now he's got a new script in the works.
which means he's having nightmares again?
he's very excited about it.
the nightmares.
he's excited about the script.  you should be too.  it stars you.
can i read it?
he's not showing it until it's down.  but it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  you and robert got great ratings today. which is the first thing we needed to know.
you mean that was a...
sort of a trial balloon.
i don't know, bob.  i'm flattered and all, but i've got a kid, now.
so?
so i don't know about horror.
come on.  kids love horror.
and i...i've got other things happening.
i'm sure we can match any offer.
sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  you rate right up there.  we've already got chase working on a prototype for the glove.
what?
i know.  we asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  look, how about we get in touch your agent.  you still with jerry?
yes, but...
we'll work something out.  i'm sure you'll be happy with it.
bob, how long has wes been working on this script?
i don't know.  a couple months.  why?
and since you've been thinking of making it.  has anything funny happened?
i don't follow.
like weird calls, by any chance?
rex saved me.
rex?  who's rex?
no, rex is not going to die.  julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
sure.  we'll do an operation, doctor dylan and doctor julie. we'll fix him good as new.
heather?
chase. hi...
what's up?
chase, you'd better come home.
heather, i'm stuck here.  neither chuck or terry came in today.  i can't get away!
chase, it's dylan!
he's had some sort of...episode.
what?  what kind of episode?
he was just acting very strange.  he thinks somebody's after him, chase. it's scary, it scared me.  he was acting like...
like what?
like freddy.
heather, has there been another call?
chase.  why didn't chuck or terry show up?
forget those two clowns, heather.  answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
yes.
i'll be there in three hours.
don't speed, chase.  it's not...
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'we will bake cookies first,' she said.  'i have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' and she pushed gretel toward the oven. the witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  dylan, this is too violent.  i don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
finish, please!
this is going to give you nightmares.
i like this story.
time for sleep.
say how they find their way back home.
tomorrow night.
no.  tonight.  it's important!
"then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
they were safe and could sleep.
who?
the mean old man with the claws.
okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
don't let the bedbugs bite.
he's on his way.
he can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
right.
mommy's fine, dylan.  just had a bad dream.  what're you doing out of bed?
rex woke me up. he was fighting.
dylan, you go back to sleep now.
not sleepy.
heather langenkamp?
yes?
is chase porter your husband?
yes.
i'm afraid there was an accident.  it appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
i want to see the body.
no, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
i want to see for myself.
what...happened?
quake knocked you off your feet.  you got bumped pretty good, actually.
i can't sleep there, mommy.  please!
you've got to sleep, dylan, you...
in my bed.
your bed?
under my covers.  kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
and...what's the man doing?
trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
do you have to die to see god?
no, i don't think so.  you just have to...pray, or reach...
why does god let there be bad things?
i honestly don't know. try to sleep, baby.
can you come with me in my dreams?
i know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  i just can't believe it's him.  i mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  or is that how denial works?
when it is denial.  i don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. you'll see, everything's fine.
you're not crazy, by the way.
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  and jumping in...
you didn't jump in.
that's my memory.  and it seemed absolutely real.
seemed, not was.
it's in my family, you know.  my grandmother died in an institution...
really?  hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
i've never mentioned it to him.
kids know when something's bugging a parent.  you've got no idea who this is calling?
freddy, for all i know.
steady...
a man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, freddy voice.
six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got freddy in your dreams?  hell, sonny bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  even at mass.
really?
absolutely.  and how many times has letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  it gets under your skin if you let it.
you really think dylan's okay?
heather?  you doing okay?
holding my own.  you know that guy who was calling me all the time?  he's started again.  he's been putting stuff in my mail.
must've read about the funeral.  sick mother.  that's the last thing you need right now, i'm sure.
it's actually been giving me freddy nightmares.
darker.  more...evil?
yeah...how'd you know?
call it a guess...
anyway, what i was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
wes won't show it until it's finished. that's what he told me, at least.  i asked him at the funeral.
when do you think it'll be done?
the way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  i asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  oh yeah, as far as dylan trying to reach god.  weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
any history of epilepsy in your family?
no.
diabetes?
no.
was there any trigger event?  a trauma, shock or...  you haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  the horror stuff?
no...
does he have to stay here over night?
absolutely.
like what?
sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  did he say anything while he was still lucid?
home.
home, that's right.
i can tell you what the nightmares are about.  they're about this...entity. whatever you want to call it.  it's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  the only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
what's that?
killing innocence, one way or the other.
this is still a script we're talking about, right?
i think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
it can be captured, sometimes.
captured?  how?
by storytellers, of all things.  every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  then it's held prisoner for a while.  in the story.
like the genie in the bottle.
exactly.  the problem comes when the story dies. it happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  however it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
you saying freddy's this ancient thing?
current version.  for ten years he's been imprisoned as freddy by the story of nightmare on elm street.  but now that the films have stopped-  the genie's out of the bottle, heather, that's what the nightmares are about. that's what i'm writing.
if freddy's loose, i mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  another age?  another form?
that's not what the dreams say he's doing.
then what is he doing?
well, see, he's gotten used to being freddy now.  and kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  so...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
isn't there anyone that can stop him?
interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  a gatekeeper, so to speak.  someone freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  it's you, heather.
me?  why me?
dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  you played nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
that was nancy, not me!
but it was you that gave nancy her strength.  so to get out he has to come through you.  and it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
dylan.  and...  chase.  my god, wes, did you know?
heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
you know damn well it's more than that now!  how can we stop him?
the way to stop him is to make another movie.  and i swear to you i'll stay at my computer and keep writing until i finish the script.  but when that time comes...  you're gonna have to make a choice.
choice?  what kind of choice?
whether or not you're willing to play nancy one last time.
no, i don't think that at all.  how is he?
they wouldn't let me...
ms. langenkamp.  i'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in intensive care.
is he all right?
dylan?  he's holding well.  earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
oh my god...
if these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... what did you say you cut yourself on?
it was an earthquake and it was dark.  i have no idea.
these look quite fresh.
they are...it happened in tonight's quake.  it happened just fifteen minutes ago. you must've felt it.
doctor...
get her back!  i've got to go in!  get me a full anesthetic, stat!
ms. langenkamp.  i suggest you go home and get some rest.  your son is fine. he's been taken downstairs for further testing.
he was just here!
he was here.  you fell asleep.  we took him.  you looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  besides, the young woman, julie, is with him.  believe me, everything is fine.
everything is not fine!
you okay, champ?
can we go get rex, now?  the bad man's getting awful close.
i know he is, sweetie.  we'll both go get rex right now.
tell you what.  i'm gonna go get rex for you right now.  you know home isn't far from here, right?
right 'cross the freeway.
that's right.  so i won't be long. meanwhile julie's gonna be right here with you.
hurry back, please.  i'm sleepy.
promise.  cross my heart.  but until mommy gets back, dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
do you mind...
just a quick word, ms. langenkamp.  for dylan's sake.
i want my kid out of here now!
very well. as soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
you don't understand.  if dylan falls asleep,then...
no way he's going anywhere.  he's been well sedated.
he doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
what?
he sleepwalks, you idiot!  he's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  oh my god...he thinks i've gone home...
john saxon.  do you have any idea what time it is?
john.  it's heather.  i need help!
you got it.  what's happening?
dylan's run away from the hospital.  i don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  but i think freddy's after him.  i know it sounds crazy!
you're right.  that sounds crazy!
john.  will you please just look for him around the hospital?  i'm gonna go right to the house.  will you help me, john?  please!
holy...
where's dylan?!  have you seen him?
i know how chase really died.
what are you talking about?
fred krueger did it.
yeah, sure.
you saw him, didn't you, dylan!?
coming for you...
dylan, where's the man?
here.
what...what is that?
a story?
yes.  it's a story.  a story for a movie.
read me some?
might as well be, dylan.  state of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  bull tendons, nerve bundles from a doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
chase...
no.
you have a fever, sweetie?
just an earthquake, dylan.  every once in a while we get a few.
no biggie, really.
one of mom's cups got broken.

trying to get up...trying to get into our world.

i can tell you what the nightmares are about.  they're about this...entity. whatever you want to call it.  it's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  the only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
what's that?
killing innocence, one way or the other.
this is still a script we're talking about, right?
i think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
it can be captured, sometimes.
captured?  how?
by storytellers, of all things.  every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  then it's held prisoner for a while.  in the story.
like the genie in the bottle.
exactly.  the problem comes when the story dies. it happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  however it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
you saying freddy's this ancient thing?
current version.  for ten years he's been imprisoned as freddy by the story of nightmare on elm street.  but now that the films have stopped-  the genie's out of the bottle, heather, that's what the nightmares are about. that's what i'm writing.
if freddy's loose, i mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  another age?  another form?
that's not what the dreams say he's doing.
then what is he doing?
well, see, he's gotten used to being freddy now.  and kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  so...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
isn't there anyone that can stop him?
interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  a gatekeeper, so to speak.  someone freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  it's you, heather.
me?  why me?
dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  you played nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
that was nancy, not me!
but it was you that gave nancy her strength.  so to get out he has to come through you.  and it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
dylan.  and...  chase.  my god, wes, did you know?
heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
you know damn well it's more than that now!  how can we stop him?
the way to stop him is to make another movie.  and i swear to you i'll stay at my computer and keep writing until i finish the script.  but when that time comes...  you're gonna have to make a choice.
choice?  what kind of choice?
whether or not you're willing to play nancy one last time.
no, i don't think that at all.  how is he?
they wouldn't let me...
ms. langenkamp.  i'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in intensive care.
is he all right?
dylan?  he's holding well.  earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
oh my god...
if these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... what did you say you cut yourself on?
it was an earthquake and it was dark.  i have no idea.
these look quite fresh.
they are...it happened in tonight's quake.  it happened just fifteen minutes ago. you must've felt it.
doctor...
get her back!  i've got to go in!  get me a full anesthetic, stat!
ms. langenkamp.  i suggest you go home and get some rest.  your son is fine. he's been taken downstairs for further testing.
he was just here!
he was here.  you fell asleep.  we took him.  you looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  besides, the young woman, julie, is with him.  believe me, everything is fine.
everything is not fine!
you okay, champ?
can we go get rex, now?  the bad man's getting awful close.
i know he is, sweetie.  we'll both go get rex right now.
tell you what.  i'm gonna go get rex for you right now.  you know home isn't far from here, right?
right 'cross the freeway.
that's right.  so i won't be long. meanwhile julie's gonna be right here with you.
hurry back, please.  i'm sleepy.
promise.  cross my heart.  but until mommy gets back, dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
do you mind...
just a quick word, ms. langenkamp.  for dylan's sake.
i want my kid out of here now!
very well. as soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
you don't understand.  if dylan falls asleep,then...
no way he's going anywhere.  he's been well sedated.
he doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
what?
he sleepwalks, you idiot!  he's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  oh my god...he thinks i've gone home...
john saxon.  do you have any idea what time it is?
john.  it's heather.  i need help!
you got it.  what's happening?
dylan's run away from the hospital.  i don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  but i think freddy's after him.  i know it sounds crazy!
you're right.  that sounds crazy!
john.  will you please just look for him around the hospital?  i'm gonna go right to the house.  will you help me, john?  please!
holy...
where's dylan?!  have you seen him?
i know how chase really died.
what are you talking about?
fred krueger did it.
yeah, sure.
you saw him, didn't you, dylan!?
coming for you...
dylan, where's the man?
here.
what...what is that?
a story?
yes.  it's a story.  a story for a movie.
read me some?
