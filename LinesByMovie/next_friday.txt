here i come!
well bring yo' ass on...
what is the matter?
i fell in some mud.  now hurry up!
that nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  that is why moving wit'cha uncle elroy and cousin day-day is the best thing for you right now.
ya'll making me look like a punk.
it am not about being a punk, son.  it is about this...
must be your upper lip, 'cause i do not smell nothing.
i do.
what it smell like?
smells like you did not fall in no mud.
i got to get'em fixed.  they do not roll down.
all damn.
just hold your breath.
nice neighborhood, huh?
it is alright.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  i still can not figure that one out.
why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
you coming in?
no, i'mma go on to work.  i do not wanna hear elroy's mouth.  now listen to me, craig.  it is going to be different living over here.  do not let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  understand?
hey, pops, I am grown.  can not nobody get me in trouble no more.
what is crackin'?
you.  hi, uncle willie.
hey, debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
naw, it am not like that.
if you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like mike tyson.
alright, I will remember that.
you know me?  i would have shot his big ass.  hey, willie, how is it going?  still steppin' in dog shit every day?
make sure you look after my son out here. do not get him involved with none of your bullshit, roy.
do not worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  he in the best fuckin' hands in rancho chocomunga, baby!  this my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  am not that right, nephew?
craig, remember what i told you.
I will remember.
send betty my love.  boy you looking good.  i'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  i got something to show you.
thanks, unc.
you know it is been over a year since we kicked it last?  up at the family reunion.
i know, that is when uncle elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in aunt faye's backseat.
yep.  i forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  damn that was fun.
i know, we had a good time.  but ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we have lost touch.
i know; this a long way from watts.  but what i like about living out here is that you do not hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  just peace and quiet.  listen.
who is that?
joker, he just got out of the pen.  li'l joker, he just got out of youth authority.  and baby joker, he just got out of juvenile hall.
they ever let you hit the switches on that cadillac?
naw, them dudes is assholes.  especially that dog - cheeco.  watch this little ass, he is sneaky.  plus, i got something better than a cadillac.
this you?
yeah, that is me.  just a little somethin' somethin' i picked up.
must be nice.  i wish we won the lottery. come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we did not end up with a million.  we bought this house and i spent the rest on this.  it is the bomb, huh?
this my baby.  i feel like a new nigga in this car.  i get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than i ever did on the bus.
my name is miss ho kym.  day-day just trying to be a smart ass.  nice to meet you, craig.  are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
excuse me?
i said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
yeah, I am 'bout it.
well, then, it is all good.  yo, day-day, something is going down with those mexicans across the street?  I have been seeing a lot of activity.
what kind of activity?
strange activity.  i think they running drugs off tijuana.  day-day do not believe me.
see you later, day-day.  come by after work, i got the john blaze shit for you.
nice to meet you?
peace out, craig.
man, this a cool house.
thanks, i just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
go on and make yourself at home.  i'mma go get dressed for work.
oh, yeah, where you work at?
pinky's records and disc in the shopping center.  i'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'cause you been unemployed for a long time now, craig.
thanks for reminding me.
craig, i want you to meet my old lady, suga.  suga, this is craig.
oooh, ba-by!
okay, okay, that is enough.  go put on some damn clothes.
elroy.
suga.  go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
okay.  bye, craig.
man, that girl's going to kill me one day. viagra am not working.  my back keep going out... she do not never get enough.  but check this out.  i got to lay some ground rules.  your my family and i love you.  you are welcome to anything you want in my home. but i do not wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
yeah.
well, let me in.
uncle elroy, who is that girl by day-day's car?
i can not see!  i can not see!  daddy!
lay down, day-day.  stop moving.
she pepper-sprayed me, man!  she pepper- sprayed me!
i know, be still.
wet your eyes, boy.  stay in there for about 20 minutes.
20 minutes?
yeah, 20 minutes.  trust me.  I have been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
yeah, you got to have a little money to live out here, craig.  i never thought I would be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  but as soon as i got my check, i was gone.  paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
you paid cash?
cash money.  they was not going to stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  that is for suckas.  they got my daddy like that for a cadillac years ago.  i got the only house on the block that is paid for. that is why I am the king around here.
it is cool, but where is the water?
do not need water.  we did not have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
you all never use it?
never...  but me and suga can get real nasty in that jacuzzi, though.
that is okay, unc.  i can not swim, either.
good.
where did craig move to?
i do not know, debo.
what you say?
he moved out to rancho cucamonga with his cousin day-day.
rancho cucamonga?
yeah.
get on.
man, we can not ride to rancho cucamonga on that.
get on!
you straight?
yeah, I am alright.  is my face still orange to you?
just a little.
i can not taste nothing.
what is the matter with your girlfriend?
man, it is a long story.  i met d'wana three months ago.  she had a little pudge in her stomach but i did not pay it no attention.  come to find out, she six months pregnant.  saying I am the daddy!
what?
yeah, i broke up with her two fridays ago and she is been harassing me ever since. she do not care about the restraining order or nothing.
restraining order?  where the hell you meet this girl?
i went back to watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  worst day of my life.
damn, you got a stalker.
that am not the worst part.  her little sister, baby d.  she is the one that gets real physical.  but i got a restraining order on her, too.
you got a restraining order on a little girl named baby d?
you do not know baby d.
who is that?
that is the sister.
yo know what?  I am starting to like rancho cucamonga.
i know what 'cha thinking.  i thought the same thing.  but it can not happen.
why?
because, it is been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  and I am just trying to keep the peace.  we moved out here to get away from that shit.
karla.
craig and karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  where you going?
to the cucamonga shopping center.
oh yeah, why you walking?
my brothers will not give me a ride.
you want us to give you a ride?
i do not know.
what you mean, you do not know?  just wait here.
so.
what you mean, so?
if you 'get into it' with them s.a.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  i got to live here.  just remember that.
i know you smoke weed, right?
why you say that?
'cause your lips is getting black.
