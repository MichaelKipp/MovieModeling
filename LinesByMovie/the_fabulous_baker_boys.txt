you want me to show up late a few nights?
jack.
frank.
jack.
frank.  I am here.  i always get here.  do not sweat it.
christ, will you look at your hair?
what is wrong with it?
you look like you just crawled out of bed.
no one's going to be looking at my hair.  come on, we are on.
you know, my brother and i have been playing together, gosh, i do not know.  how long has it been, jack?
twenty-eight years, frank.
that is a lot of water under the bridge, eh, jack?
lotta water.
of course, back then, things were a little different.  i was eight, jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'my bonnie lies over the ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, cecil.  we must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, jack?
do not make trouble, all right?
who is going to make trouble?  hey, amigo!
i mean it, jack.  behave.
like an angel.
terrific, boys.  really.  terrific.
thanks, lloyd.
yes, sir.  you are just what we needed on a night like this.
uh ... thanks.
uh ... you do not know when you will be wanting us back, do you, lloyd?
I will call you.
uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, i thought maybe...
I will call you.
count it.
huh?
count it.
jack...
count the fucking money, frank.
you mind telling me what that was about in there? was that planned? or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
fuck him.
this is not the pine tree inn on route 81, jack.
fuck him.
fuck him.  great.  terrific.  fuck him.
so we on tomorrow night?
maybe thursday.  i hear the harpist at the sheraton's got appendicitis.
listen ... why do not you come out to the house this weekend.  say hello to the kids. they have grown.
i hate your kids, frank.
you are their uncle.
only by relation.  besides, they hate me, too.
they don't.  they are always asking about you.
they tried to electrocute me, frank.
it was an accident.
it was no fucking accident, frank. the little one ...
cindy.
she threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. how do you explain that?
she did not know what she was doing. you are too sensitive.
you got weird kids, frank.
look, i just thought if you came out you might see what you are missing.
what happened to the two clays, willie?
out.
when they coming in?
wednesday next. frank looks across the room at jack.
what d'ya got?,
bosen black.  flat.

you know, i think it is been five years since i saw you eat anything. that is the god's truth.
trust me, you are not missing anything.
you look awful.
thanks.
really.  you sleeping?
only on odd days.
seeing anyone in particular?
why the interest?
because I am your brother.  because i care about you. because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
I am not seeing anyone.  in particular.
what about that waitress at the ambassador?
uh-uh.  how about you?  you seeing anyone?
funny.  strike a bell?
it is only a ring.  not a collar.
it is more than that.
by the way, we gotta go see ma tomorrow.
no thanks.
no, i mean it.
so do i.
we gotta go, jack.
no, you got to go 'cause if you do not get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. i will not feel guilty, so i do not got to go.
this time you gotta go.
i do not got to go.
you gotta go.
says who?
your older brother.
you are thirteen months older than me, frank. that might have meant something in the apache clubhouse, but it do not cut too deep anymore.
christ, jack, it is her birthday.
so what did we get her?
you will see.
well, if it is not the fabulous baker boys!
how is the birthday girl?
a little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
john.  it is good to see you.
good to see you, ma.
uh, ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. jack. he goes by jack.
i thought maybe held gotten over that.
twenty years, ma ...
yes, yes.  it is just that john is so much nicer. jack sounds so ... crude. when i was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named jack. i guess i just can not help making the association.
uh ... yeah, well, you know, ma, john kennedy went by jack.
catholics.  what do you expect? oh, well, what is in a name, right? let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
well, now, where is everyone run off to? frank?
downstairs.
so. how are you?
fine.  you?
oh, fine.
big piece or little?
huh? oh, no.

I am not much for sweets.

eddie.
yes.  right.  eddie.  how is he?
he is losing his teeth.
oh my god ...
recognize these two characters?
i thought these were lost. where did you find ...
in the attic.  behind some of dad's stuff.  look, jack can hardly reach the pedals.
oh no!
i had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  boy, old man henderson did not fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, jack?
oh, look at you two.  so skinny. and those tiny suits ...
wait.  watch.  here comes dad.
i made her nervous.
what do you mean?
her hands.  like that.
did you break a cup, jack?
eddie did.
guess they are up.
sounds big.  what is he do?
process server. ma said it is like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  all i know's he came to take the tv one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  and breakfast.
what happened to the donut king?
married.
frankie.
you wanted to see me, charlie?
yeah, come on in.
little slow tonight.
mondays.
what is this?
your pay.
now?  why not tomorrow?  after the show.
take it now.
what about tomorrow?
we do not need you, frankie.
I have got the grands for two nights, charlie.  you can not just --
it is all there.  both nights.
what are you saying, charlie?
look, frankie.  you and jack been playing here, a long time.
twelve years.
right, twelve years.  couple times a month.
so?
so maybe it is time we took a vacation from each other.
vacation?  christ, charlie, it is a monday night. you said so yourself.
it was not half full out there tonight, frankie. i got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  i got to move the liquor. to move the liquor, i got to fill the tables. it is a matter of economics.  me, i love you. i love both you guys, you know that. you are class.  but people today. they do not know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
what is with charlie?
nothing.  everything's great. terrific.
yeah?
it is me.
frank?
yeah.  listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I have had enough family for one month, frank.
it is not family.  it is business.
so talk to me tomorrow.  after the gig.
we do not get a gig.
what are you talking about?
something came up.  do not worry, charlie stayed true.  both nights. I will give you your share tomorrow. at the house.
so you will come out, right?
yeah, okay.
jack.
your doorbell does not work.
honey, it is only uncle jack.  you remember uncle jack.
nothing's the matter. is it, sweetheart?
I will take her inside.  you too, little frank.  out of the pool.
well, look at this.
you bring trunks, jack?
trunks?
swimming trunks.
oh. no. strictly dryland.
too bad.  you could use some sun. really.
maybe next time.
we have some lotion.
just the same.
suit yourself.
nice, huh?
what?
the trees.  the flowers.  nice.
terrific.
yeah ... we are going to paint in the spring. after the rains.  look good as new.
you ask me out here to sell me your house, frank?
charlie paid you off last night, did not he?
i do not know what you mean.
the hell you don't.
i told you.  something came up. some political dinner or something.
bullshit.  fifteen years, frank. no one paid us off.
it was not like that.
no?
no.
what was it like?
hey pal, i got a mortgage, all right? i got two kids. i got a wife. besides, he made the deal. there is no shame in it.
that how you see it?
a gust of wind killed him.
yeah, and what put him up there?
hey, you were not there.  right?
look, can we forget last night? we gotta talk.
talk.
i been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  i been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
sure, why not.
it is just an idea.  i want your opinion. i mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
it is more like 40-60, would not you say?
we agreed that if i took care of the business; I would be entitled to the extra. is not that what we agreed?
that is what we agreed.
if you are unhappy with the arrangement --
I am not unhappy.
if you would like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I would be glad --
frank.  fuck it.  okay?
I have tried to do well by you, jack. by both of us.
I am grateful, frank.  how much? for the singer.
i thought maybe twenty percent. look, with the additional bookings we will come out ahead.  the big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. we have to stay competitive, jack.
what is that?
you, frank.  all these years you been telling me we are different.  we got novelty, jack. no one can touch us.
two pianos is not enough anymore, jack.
it never was.
actually, that is my stage name.
I am sorry?
moran.  monica.  the whole thing. it is my stage name.  my real name's blanche.
blanche.
no romance, right?  that is why i came up with monica. it is what i prefer.
well, that is fine --
but if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for blanche.  if you ask for monica, she will think you have the wrong number and hang up.
right.
and if she asks what it is about, do not tell her. she is opposed to my career.
uh-huh.  well, miss moran, what is it you would like to do for us?
candy man.'  is that all right?
it is one of jack's favorites.
uh... he knows it.
really?  is not that a coincidence.
oh, sorry.  i get so caught up in it sometimes.  it is scary.
yes, it is.
well ... thanks.  bye.
thirty-seven.  thirty-seven.
what?
thirty-seven girls. and not one who can carry a tune. that must be statistically impossible.
it was a somewhat extraordinary day.
i just do not understand.  you would think someone ... anyone ...
this where the auditions are?
this is where the auditions were.
what do you mean?
we are finished.
what about me?
you are an hour and a half late.
my watch is broken, too.
punctuality.  first rule of show business.
this is show business?
look, miss.  we are tired, you have gum on your lip, and we are going home.
just like that, huh?  you are not even going to give me a chance?
do not take it personally.
how should i take it?
impersonally.
i do not believe it.  i come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you are not going to give me a chance because i have gum on my lip and I am a few minutes late.
you are an hour and a half late.
so if I am so 'late how come you are still here?
we ran long.
so run a little longer.
miss --
you find a girl?
no.
so. I am here, you are here, the piano's here.  what d'ya say?
terrific.  thirty-eight.
what is that mean?  thirty-eight.
do not worry about it.
you know, I am feeling a lot of hostility from you.
jack.
let's get it over with.
all right.  what is your name?
susie.  susie diamond.
catchy.  you have any previous entertainment experience, miss diamond?
hey, it is legit.  strictly dinner and dance.
okay.  i think that is all we need to know.
i sing now?
that is the premise.
so?
uh ... we will let you know.
when?
when we know.
do not leave a girl hanging. second rule of show business.
what are you, crazy?
i just thought we should talk about it.  between ourselves.
what is there to talk about?  she can sing. that puts her at the head of the class. that makes her the only one in the class.
i do not know ... she had gum on her lip, for christ sake. i do not think she is right for the act.
you are getting cold feet about this.
i was just thinking what ma would think.
ma? ma?  was ma there the last time we played the ambassador?  oh, that is right, she was on bass. how could i forget.
how many other silent partners are there, frank? donna?  little cindy? hell, let's give eddie a vote.
okay, okay.  I will call the girl.
what is the matter?
i did not get her number.
ready?
what are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
what is the problem?
the problem is i can not hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  you know what I am saying?
i mean, you are supposed to be backing me up, right?
no. we are not supposed to be backing you up.
what i mean is --
we are a team.  we work together.
so work with me, not against me. okay?
i suppose we can bring it down a little.
I will drop the eighths.
okay?
hey, he is not sore, is he?
he will come around.
you never sang before?
not for money. with my mother.
in the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
is that what you used to do?
my days are not the old days, genius.
what are they?
the recent past.
oh.  bigfoot gets his out of a can.
how do you know?
i saw his stuff in the bathroom.
oh?
i guess it is getting serious.
maybe he will ask your ma to marry him.
i hope not.  he is already busted the springs in two chairs.  hey, what is this?
ivory.
looks old.
older than me.
wow.
hey, what do you want to do?  grow a beard?
why not?
well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
what is a prom?
ever go to church?
where the hell is she?
it is early.
i told everyone seven-fifteen. did not i? seven-fifteen.
she will get here.
just like the day of the auditions, right?  jesus.  how is my hair?
awe inspiring.
yeah, well, your's isn't.  let me run a comb though it.
get out of here.
come on, stand still.
get out of here!
it is not going to hurt you.
I will hit you, frank.  i swear.
you hit me.
i told you i was gonna hit you.
all right, all right.  I am a little tense.
you are a fucking alarm clock.
i just wish she would get here, that is all.
she is here.
christ, look at her. you would think if she was going to wear her street clothes she would have enough sense to come in the back.  good evening, miss diamond.  you are late.
where is my name?
what-?
and how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
we will talk about it later.  right now, you got to get changed.
changed?
where is your dress?
what is he talking about?
is there a language problem here?  your dress. for tonight.  where is it?
do i look like I am naked?
that!  you can not wear that!
what is wrong with it?
it is orange!
am i missing something?
come on.
hey!
come on.  we do not have much time.
time for what?
if you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
just look.  what do you wear? a nine?
a seven.
my wife wears a seven.  you do not look like a seven to me.
i wear a seven.
okay, okay.  here, how about this?
save it for your wife.
we are not exactly silly with time, you know.  jack, you find anything?
no.
here, how is this?
hey, pal.  i do not know about you, but where i come from there is a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys do not go where the little girls go.
all right, but make it quick.  shoes!  what size do you wear?
nine.
nine?
nine!
big feet.
see anything?
how about these?
jack, for crying out loud.  your bachelorhood's showing.  ah, here we go.
what do you think?
uh... good.
zip me up?
shoes?
right.
they are tight.
they are nines.
well, they are aspiring to be sevens.
you can buy new ones tomorrow.
oh, thanks.
do not worry.  we will take it out of your share.
you are a prince.
we need scissors over here! who is got scissors?  okay, remember.  jack and i go on first, i do the set-up, then introduce you. and you say ...
good evening, ladies and gentlemen. i can not tell you how thrilled i am to be here. it is like a dream come true. and speaking of dreams ...
right.
piece of cake.
oh, brother.
and it is especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and i. this evening we have asked a young lady to join us, a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  she is making her debut here this evening and, as far as I am concerned, she could not be doing it in a better place. because there is one place that is always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the ambassador lounge.  ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, miss susie diamond.
the switch.  hit the switch.
switch?  what fucking switch?
fucking.  she says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
i said i was sorry.
did you hear it?
fucking.
look, they were all on their third mai tais by the time i got out there anyway.
fucking.
for christ sake, i said it, i did not do it.  besides, i do not think they were too offended, do you?
give me that.
hey!
we are not a saloon act.  we do not take tips from dirty old men.
i was gonna split it with you guys.
we do not take tips.  I will apply this to the cost of the dress.
yes, sir.  that is quite a girl you boys latched onto.  she a local?
born and bred.
lucky for you.  well, there you go, guys. do not spend it all in one place. oh ... you want to count it, jack?
we trust you, lloyd.  you know that.
barker.  jock barker?
baker.  jack baker.
right.  bring him back.
come on, ed.
you should have brought a leash, mr. barker. the doctor does not like to be bitten.
he does not bite.
they never do, mr. barker.
baker.
right.  in there.
beasley.
baker.
what is our friend's problem?
teeth.
what is wrong with them?
they are falling out.
uh-oh.  that is not good.  let's get him up here.
they gotta go.
how many?
five's my guess.  maybe more. will not know till i get in there.  leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
is not there something you can give him?  a pill or something?
decay unfortunately does not limit itself to the denture, mr. baker. it spreads into his chest. then the heart goes. we would not want that, would we?
how will he eat?
start him out on cottage cheese. if you have got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
no bones?
no bones.
what do you do to him?
do not worry, mr. baker.  we will knock him out. he will not feel a thing.
i think maybe I will bring him back next week ...
the sooner we do this the better, mr. baker.
jack, you with us?
the carlton's a dump.  no cover.  no minimum. and they water their drinks. it is strictly for the fuller brush crowd.
i guess it's,the plaza then. that brings us to the twenty-seventh. we got the avedon for three or the park downtown for two.
we take the avedon, right?  simple.
the park?  it is only two nights. why throw away a night?
because blackie carson books the park and whenever we have needed a gig he is come through.
oh.  well, for blackie then.
by the way, i got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for new year's action.  resort, upstate.
hey.
sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
that is what i figure.  probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
maybe it is legit.
maybe.  I will call him.
make it collect.
that is it except for the first. we got the sheraton, the ambassador, or the holiday inn on sixtieth.  all three-day turns.
uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
so find a dime.  let's get out of here.
better take care of your fingers, little brother. buy yourself a case of arthritis and you will not be able to play 'chopsticks.'
I will take my chances.
something, huh?  all those bids.
yeah.  something.
yeah ... well, i gotta go.
you wanna get a drink?
you all right?
yeah, fine.
okay I will see you tomorrow night then.
right.
where is egghead?
his kid's sick.
i do not know.  it is hard figuring you two as brothers.  seems like the hospital might have scrambled the babies somewhere.
he takes after our mother.
yeah,well, a11 i know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  shit.
uh-uh.  i never touch american cigarettes.  what is tomorrow again?
the stratford.
nice place.  fulla velvet.  even the bedspreads.  damn!  two-fifty a pack and i go through 'em like toothpicks. twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
huh?
paris opals.  twelve-and-a-half cents.  i sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  but i figure, if you are going to be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  ah, here's a lost soul.
mmm.  like kissing a rose.  well, au revoir.
hey.  you feel like a cup of coffee?
you kidding?  we must have killed three pots in there.  anyway, i got to get home.  rest the pipes.
you want me to walk you?
no. thanks. she starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
hey, listen.  you are not going soft on me, are you? i mean, you are not going to start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I am some kinda princess when i burp.
forget it.
i mean, that would be too creepy. with us working together and all.
forget it.
nothing personal --
no, i, uh, left a dog here this morning. he needed some work on his mouth.
regular hours are eight to five.
yeah, yeah, i know.  i was just passing by. thought I would check in on him.
you can check in on him tomorrow. between eight and five.
yeah, well, could not i take a look now?
you want to know if he is okay. right?
yeah.
all right.  hold on.
the name's baker --
save it.  what is he look like?
black.  labrador.
all right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I will take a look.
i tried cheerios this morning. he did not even get up. maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
he is just feeling sorry for himself.  this is it, pal.  hear me? two bucks a can.
hey, frank.
you recognized me.
just a lucky guess.
so what do you think?
very realistic.
yeah, well, what can i say?  dad must have had forty pounds on me. jesus, you remember him being this big?
yeah.
well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. lucky for us there are not any dragons left to slay.
you want to come out to the house tomorrow? the way the bookings been piling up, donna's decided to really lay it on.  turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  we could use another appetite.
thanks, but I have got plans.
all right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  i gotta go get ma in the morning anyway.
well, well.  ho, ho, ho.  you moonlighting at macy's, frank?
for the kids.  merry christmas, you two.  do not forget.  we leave the twenty-sixth.
he do that every year?
every year.
are not the kids asleep?
every year.
so why is he do it?
i guess in case one year they are not.
how did the show go?
okay.  how did yours go?
not so good.
from hurley's?
eighty proof. what d'ya say? think you can handle it?
jack.
yeah?
can i stay here tonight?  even if she comes here?
merry christmas, jack.
merry christmas.
there were more flowers last year.  mr. rinaldi down at the drugstore says it is going to snow by new year's.  says he can feel it in his elbows. i hope it snows.  i want to make a snowman. you ever make a snowman, jack?
sure.
that is what i want to do. i want to make a snowman.
you two could play checkers.
maybe we should just listen to the radio.
sorry.  it only plays static.
you play all these places?
baker's unabridged.
jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  what is with the stars?
virgins.
virgins?
first times. hey, look at this.
when is the last time we played a wedding, jack?
two years ago.  march.
he is right.
he is always right.  go ahead.  pick a virgin.
go ahead.
okay.the fantasy inn.
jack?
november.  '71.
first night?
day.  wednesday.
last?
sunday.
i do not believe it.
i told you, he is got the gift.  same with music. hears it once and he is got it.
and how about this air? I am telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
smells like fish.
of course it smells like fish. we are on the ocean. what did you expect, chanel number five?
smells like tuna number two to me.
it is paradise.  that is what it is. paradise.
hey, we are connected.
great.
great?
yeah.
i thought we had separate rooms.
we do.  she is got hers, we have got ours. hey. wash and dries.
i thought we all had separate rooms.
come on, jack.  it is not like it is the first time we have bunked together.  it will be like when we were kids.  relax.  enjoy the view.
you are kidding me.
as charlie steinway is my witness.
peggy lee?
tell her.
she was staying at the grand downtown ...
it was april.  april seventeenth. that one i remember.
we were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
pearls.  white gown.  beautiful.
frank asked if she would sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
a few bars!
what did she sing?
people.' you think streisand, right? hot that night.  chills. through the whole audience.  i could hardly play.
wow. you ever see her again?
no. we got a picture, though. one of the waitresses had a camera.  god, we were just kids.  that was something, was not it?
hey, will you look at that?
they must have bought the same map we did.
what do you say we send a bottle over?
i do not believe it.  you are a romantic, frank.
he is drunk.
not true.  besides, jack's the romantic.
oh yeah?
he is just afraid to show it. are not you, little brother?
have some more wine, frank.
good idea.  to peggy lee.
I am putting my stuff on the right, okay?
okay.
i figure that way we will not get confused.
right.
unless you want the right.
no, you take the right.
we might as well do the towels the same way.
okay.
i just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
good idea.
but if it does not work out, let me know.  i'm,flexible.
right.
you leaving that on?
yeah.
all night?
yeah.
we are going to be here a week?
yeah.
so you are going to leave it on. every night.  for a week.
yeah.  you mind?
why would i mind?
i do not know.  i mean, i always did it as a kid. i figured it was no big deal.  is it?  a big deal?
good morning, gentlemen.  I am mr. daniels, the manager.  i believe I have spoken to one of you on the phone.
that would be me, sir.  frank baker. this is my brother jack.
tom here tells me there is a problem with the pianos.  we were assured they were in tune.
yes, well, they are.
then I am afraid i do not understand.
they are in tune.  but not with each other.
is that important?
uh, well ...
accommodate?  i do not think i know what you mean.
i think what mr. daniels is trying to say, jack, is --
why do not we let mr. daniels tell us what he is trying to say.
jack ... jack ... you are acting like a kid.
no, that is your problem, frank.  you get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
what is the matter with you?  so the piano's a little out of tune.  so what?
christ, can not you hear it?
no! i never hear it!  maybe.  sometimes.  i do not know. but i will not let it bother me.
does not it matter to you?
what matters to me is we have got the six easiest nights we have had in ten years. so 'tie a yellow ribbon' sounds a little flat. so what?  nobody's going to hear it, jack.  nobody. so why should you care?
because i can hear it.
well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six of the clock we are going to walk into that dining room with smiles on. understand, little brother?
what is with you two?
jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
thank you, thank you.  you know, susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the king corporation's moorish manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. and it is their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  so, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... do not be a stranger. stop.  say hello.  introduce yourself.  because here, there are no strangers, only friends. and family.  right, jack?
right.  i love you, frank.
what?
i love you.  i just wanted to say it.
uh, well, i love you, too, jack.  so. susie.  how 'bout it.
huh?
got another song for us?
oh. yeah.  i gotta bunch of them.
well then ... shall we?
what is the matter with you?
I am sorry, frank.  all that talk about family. i just got emotional.
how dare you say you love me.
it will not happen again.  scout's honor.
what is with you guys?
someone needs to grow up.  i will not take it, jack.
oh, sorry.  with the light always on, it is hard to tell.
it is okay.  last one.
can not sleep?
in and out.
it is the waves.  god's music, my mother used to say. she was crazy for the ocean.
yeah, well, i wish god would go a little easy on the trumpets.
how is egghead?
like a baby. you?
in and out.
if you want, i got a pack in the room.
no thanks.  i never touch french cigarettes.
what the hell are you doing?
what is it look like I am doing? I am tuning a goddamn piano.
really.
yes, really.  i do not want you to be unhappy, jack.  if you say it is out of tune, it is out of tune.
how is it coming?
fine.
how long you been at it?
half-hour.  once i finish this octave I am going to get breakfast.  you see what is on the buffet?
they stopped serving two hours ago.
two hours ago!
time flies, huh?
you have not seen susie, have you?
no. why?
just wonder what she is up to. i never see her.  makes me nervous.
she is a big girl.
yeah, well, she is our girl now.  i think we better keep an eye on her.  there is trouble there.  hey, listen to this.  ethel and bert lane. married seventy-five years.  you believe that?
what the hell are these?
dedications.  i came up with the idea on the road. see, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  the guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  daniels went crazy for the idea.  and that is not all.  last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  like he wants to line something up. i think he is got a hard-on for susie.
I am sorry to interrupt, but when i saw you sitting here, i just had to come over.  florence simmons.
uh ... frank baker.  this is my brother.
funny, huh?
what?
thinking there is someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  wonder if i saw him I would think it was you?
forget your tie, handsome ... frank!
you want to tell me what the hell's going on?
huh?
i just saw a man walk out of your room.
uh ...
in case you have forgotten, we are being paid to be here.  so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
decency?  hey listen, pal ...
no. you listen.  i had my doubts about you from the beginning
what are you trying to do?  wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
we were just having a little discussion about morality.
some discussion.
i just saw a man walk out of your room!
you saw wrong.
huh?
he is with the hotel.  i called him.
what are you talking about?
we had a leak in the bathroom. he fixed it.
he was wearing a suit.
he had to come quickly.  it was a big leak.
how come i did not hear anything?
you are a heavy sleeper, frank. you have always-been a heavy sleeper.  unlike me.
i guess i ... if i jumped to...
forget it.
yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
hey, business is business.
it was not business.  it was pleasure.
just dinner and dance, right?
what are you doing down here?
celebrating.  join me?
the party's over.
no, you are wrong.  it is just beginning. come on, have a drink. show your big brother how it is done.
expensive hangover.
a gift.  courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, mr. daniels.  we, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  yup.  they want us back.  easter.  it seems they have this egg hunt every year.  only not for kids. adults.  they stuff these plastic eggs with timexes and little certificates for free mai tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  then afterwards, they have a dance.  an egg dance.  everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  it is our job to separate the yolks from the whites. slippery business.
the royal.
right.  the royal.  when is the last time we were there?
couple years.
february?
april.
right.  it is incredible how you do that.  remember things.
a useless talent.
drove me crazy when we were kids. the way you never looked at the music. miss simpson would just play it and ...
they were simple songs.
not for me.  i still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  otherwise, i forget. i just forget.  but you.  you never forget. ever.  so how come you could not remember ma's birthday?
i told you.  it is a useless talent.
god, the old man would have loved this view, would not he?
yeah.
i always think of him on new year's. how he used to pour us each half a can of beer. remember?
you always threw up.
yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. he loved that about you.
he was just having fun.
it was like you would passed some test, you know?
it was just a can of beer, frank.
yeah, but he told you things.  he never told me anything.  even though i was the oldest. it was always you two, running off, doing things together.
you could have come.
i could've.  but he did not want me to.
you are making things up, frank.
maybe so.  you ever go back there?  where it happened.
give me the keys.
you are not going to drive.
give me the keys!
you are not going to drive!
it is my goddamn car!
it is our goddamn car!
give me the keys.
no.
that takes care of this week.  the tenth we got the sheraton, the sixteenth we are at the capri.
the tenth's out.
what?
i can not make the tenth.
what do you mean?
i mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
be reasonable, jack.
i play two hundred nights a year with you, frank. how much more reasonable you expect me to be?
how about you?  got a bar mitzvah this weekend?
huh?
forget it.
i can not sing it anymore.
what?
that song.  i can not sing it anymore. I am going to get sick.
what are you talking about?  they love it.
I am going to throw up, frank.  i mean it. let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
susie.  it is one more show.  one more time.  that is all.
and two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  frank, i can not sing that fucking song anymore!
relax.  we will drop the song.
guess i got a little scattered.
it is a shitty  song.
how do you do it? every night?
practice.  there are worse songs, you know. not many, but a few.
i can keep the beat.
better than that.
what is the matter?
nothing.
what did i say?
nothing.
you are upset.
I am not upset.
all i said was you were good.
look. you do not know good. all right?
what is that supposed to mean?
it means you would not know good if it came up and fucked you.
you were good.
let's make a deal.  you shut up.
you were good.
how do you know?
because i saw the other people! and they knew you were good! you were good, goddamnit!
nina?
who is nina?
friend.
friend?  what is she look like? maybe i can help you find her.
she is four feet tall.  ed?
ed? how many people live here?
i have to make him some chili. okay?
sure.
like diamonds, huh?  i never get over it. when i was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.like i could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  she would take my hand and when she closed her eyes, i do not know, it was like she really believed it.
how come you did not close your eyes?
you know, i saw you guys once. you and frank.  at the roosevelt.
must have been a cheap date.
soap convention.
soap?
yeah, they got a convention for everything. at least he was clean.  boy, the guys i met when i was with the service, you would not believe.  the older ones, they were okay.  nice.  polite.  pulled the chair out for you.  but the younger ones ...  mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, do not dance with him again.  she thought she had it all figured out. but she was not so smart.  there are killers with palms like a baby.
history.
huh?
my father proposed to my mother in there.
no kidding?
the both of them?  in there?
he called her.
oh. so what is it doing here?
long story.
you sending me home?
they would been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in brookhaven.  usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  anyway, he starts walking home, only as he is walking he starts getting nervous.
nervous?
by the time he gets to the corner newstand, he is got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he is reading about it in the morning edition.
you are kidding.
he had a mind that escalated things.
so, what happened?
he calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he is crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he is crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he is got his brothers down there and they are tearing the thing right off the curb.
i do not know.  maybe he thought some rich guy was going to try and call her.
wow.  but i still do not see how ...
ma did not want it around.  after.
oh.
frank said ---
frank was not 'there.
oh. hi.  sorry.
coffee?
yeah... no.
look, if you want to leave...
yeah, maybe ... no. god, i hate these cigarettes!
shit.  i think i started a fire.
if our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
you can always get another girl.
there is always another girl.
sick?  how sick?
the flu.
so she is got a few sniffles.
doctor's orders.
you got no right springing this on me, frankie. it is unethical.
look, nick.  you want us to pack up, we will pack up.
what am i gonna do?  put a record player out there?  bad, frankie.  bad.
what are you doing?
just until we find another girl.
cancel, frank.
you want to know how much i got tied up in deposits with willie?  we are in for three weeks solid, jack.
better give her pneumonia.
you know, my brother and i have been playing together, gosh, i do not know.  jack?
twenty-eight years.
you should have told us you were coming, ma. we would have come and got you.
spur of the moment.
so what did you think?
thrilling.  both of you.
the audience was a little off tonight.
a few empty tables.  it is cozier. besides, mel torme could not fill this place on a wednesday night.
i guess you're,right.  well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? theo's should still be open.
no, no.  you boys are tired.
no, we are not.  jack?
no.
I am tired.  really.  i should get home.
you sure?
just call me a cab.
a cab?  ma, come on.  my car's just a half block down.  you wait here.
all right.
it went well tonight.
frank works hard.
and you don't?
he leads, i follow.
is that the way it is?
pretty much.
he mentioned you had a girl for a while.  a singer.
for a while.  she left.
yes, well, it is probably best. no sense bringing someone else in.
i suppose.
you miss him, do not you?
it is been a long time, ma.
yes.  i supposed you still have that old phone booth.
your limo's ready, ma.
all right.
we are not getting paid then.
no.
nothing. we get nothing.
i told you, jack.  it is a telethon. no one gets a cent.
what is it for?
i do not know. some disease.
what disease?
i do not know.
you do not know?
it is a disease, jack.  we are against it. it is not a moral decision.
what channels it on?
seventy-one
seventy-one?  what is seventy-one?
a channel. it is just a little further down the dial, that is all. look, it is publicity.  publicity's publicity.  right?
you the magician?
no.
oh.  what do you do?
piano.
two at a time?
my brother and i. one each.
oh.
what is wrong with the kid?
knee.  tore it up against st. anthony's.  right before the accident.
accident?
the fire.  the way we are going we will be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
we are on after meadowlark.  what is wrong?
are you kidding me?  are you fucking kidding me?
what?
we are playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
what?
jack, you are on television.
shut up, frank.
what do you say we go for a walk, pal.
get your hand off me.
come on, friend.  i can smell it on you. get yourself a cup of coffee.  you will forget what you are angry about.
go fuck yourself.
you are a real tough guy when the ladies are around, are not you, ace?
i do not see any ladies here. except maybe you.
what-are you?  a fucking moron? it is three of the clock in the morning, frank.  who is watching?  your wife? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank's birthday party. what do you think?
look.  i did not know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  what was i supposed to do? i had the pianos anyway.
basketballs, frank.  you had us playing for basketballs.
I am sorry.  i should have checked it out.  i screwed up.  but that does not mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
what?
it was not professional, jack.  it was a stunt. a stupid-ass stunt.
what is happening to you, frank?  you been kissing ass so long you are starting to like it?  you let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  we were always small time, but we were never clowns, frank. what is happened to your dignity?
dignity?  who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
stay off it.
no, let's stay on it.  I am sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. for christ sake, jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  he left a wife and two sons.  he was not a hero.  he was a fool.
you were not there.
that is right.  i was not there.  i do not have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
fuck you.
no, fuck you.  and fuck him too. fuck the both-of you.
jack!
who is weak now, big brother?
saw the sign outside.  got your own sign, huh?
yeah.  got my own sign.
so ... ?
we outgrew each other.
yeah, well, like i said, it did not figure.  you two.
you do not pick your brother.
yeah.
so how is the cat food business?
terrific.  I am doing vegetables next week.
what kind?
huh?
vegetables.
oh. carrots.  and peas.  none of the important ones.
listen... you want to get a drink?  i got a new place.  or we could go to a bar ...  well, maybe not a bar.  but i know a place uptown, if you want --
I have given it up.
tell egghead i said hi.  if you see him.
if i see him.
honey ...
you believe this?  the kid will not come out.  I am playing 'camptown races' for him and the next thing i know he is locked himself in the bathroom. there is nothing sharp in there, is there?
honey ...
where are our kids? has he got one of them in there?
frank.
jack.
hi.
well, this is some surprise.  hey ... you do not look so good, pal.
let me get the light.
no.
sneak out in the morning.  before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  never figured I would be on the other end of it, though.
i did not want to wake you.
yeah.
thanks.  for letting me in last night.
funny how life repeats itself, huh?  over and over. like a song.
i did not hear you come in.
what are you doing?
oh ... i was just hoping for something to drink.  but it seems the old lady was dry. not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
uh, we already boxed some things.  i figured you would want to go through dad's stuff.  it is in there. if you want to get started.
later.
is everything done?  the arrangements, i mean.
oh. yeah.  it was all worked out before, you know. she and dad had taken care of it.
right.
i set it for wednesday.  the ceremony.  they are doing the stone today.  it is okay?  wednesday?
yeah, fine.
there is not going to be a viewing. i figured with the kids and all ...
sure.
go ahead.
no.
bought it on the way over.  clean as a nun.
no, it is not that.  i ... can not drink from the bottle.  i ... gag.
oh, yeah, right.  i forgot.
hey, what do you know.  looks like we can have that drink after all.  what is your pleasure?  we got the downtown ramada. we got the travelodge on route 41. and ... the mallory.
I will take the mallory.
good choice.
looks like these got a few years on them.
this'll kill 'em.
how're your hands?
oh. fine.  it was nothing.  couple sore knuckles.  nothing.
you know, that night, i ... it just all came up.
yeah, i know.  me, too.
i mean, you can play.  you are okay.
i can keep the beat.
charlie called.
yeah?
yeah.  larry shelton.  blackie.  couple others. donna said even lloyd called the other day. nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
yeah.
jesus, when was the last time we played the mallory?
five years ago.  november.
right.  it was someone is birthday. halloran?
daughter's.  sweet sixteen.
christ, that is right.  how could i forget.  what a nightmare.
she asked for it.
i told halloran we did not do vocals, but he said:
