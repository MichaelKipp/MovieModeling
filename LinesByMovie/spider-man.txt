otto, i don't like thorkel any more than you do.  but he has got a point.
rosomoff, i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents.
perhaps. but every now and then someone pays attention.  you did.
good morning, liz.
how very dull, peter parker.
it's too early to be clever.
it's never too early to be clever. describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
huh?
fill in the blank: "i blank elizabeth allan."
i-- uh--
uh is a good start.
i lov-loathe elizabeth allan. abhor, detest, despise--
oh.  well, i hate you and everyone who looks like you.
i hate the platonic idea of you.
i hate people with alliterative names.
i hate--
i hate your relatives, i hate your coffee, i hate your shoes.
no.  i was lying about the coffee.
thank god.
you maniac.  you'll blow your scholarship.
they'll never take me alive.
what's in there?
a little bunny i saved from dissection.
harry!
mr. parker.
hi, professor.  what's up?
-- but the dogs treed him between huxley and kafka.
poor harry.  always desperate for attention.  what about the bunny?
back to the lab.  harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
he'll weasel out of trouble. again.
maybe.  i could have stopped it, though.
since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
my my.
yeah.  really gets to you if you let it.
i suppose.
you want to give them something, but they'll just buy more ripple. and they smell so... bad.
what?
god, flash can be such a jerk.
but you like that in a man?
you should write that one down.
"flash," liz.  you're going out with something that calls itself "flash."
some prep school thing.
does it have a human name?
eugene.  admit it, peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "flash."
i'd never admit that.
hurry up, flash!
what are you doing this weekend?
i've gotta study.
oh. maybe i should, too--
lizzy!
i was sort of hoping to get out of--
i'm parked illegally!
too hip.  your photos suck, kid.
i think you're trying to tell me something.
come on, that's pure luck!  the guy was in the right place at the right time--
you make your own luck, parker! get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
there's nothing in there worth stealing!
that's the understatement of the year.
aunt may, you're trespassing.
your records are older than you are.  have you never heard of new wave?
when i moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
oh, peter. a zit.
i am old enough to--
--but i didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
i'll introduce you.
ick.  and those foul chemicals in the pots--
i'm a photographer, remember?
anyway, i've decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills--
it's friday night...
yes.  do you have a date?
no.
the record--
it'll shut itself off.
ha.  anti-gravitational particles.
power down.  i need to talk to you.
proof.  proof of a unified field. not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
let's talk in the hall.
in this obsolete little cyclotron, i'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th century.  with more power, i could--
i've had an extremely bad day, octavius.  a sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
i couldn't care less.  what i've done is--
what you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. you compare yourself to einstein; your colleagues compare you to bozo the clown.
this is the unified field!  all the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
you've used up your grant. the electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
i don't care.  cretin.
that nobel prize will just have to wait.
no!
here you go, pete.
uh, uncle ben, i--
what, want a glass?
no. no, that's okay.
so, uh... how's college goin'?
same old stuff.  how's the pharmacy?
ah, ya know.  neighborhood's not what it used to be.  kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
you stop him?
wasn't worth gettin' upset over a milky way.  anyways, i was never much for, ya know, discipline.
i know.  still thinking about retiring?
eh.  if i ever get out from under. maybe take may to france or somethin'.
ya still follow the mets, pete?
no…not really.
s'funny.  when your mom and dad, uh, passed away, i had this idea. i wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
remember little league?
yeah, babe ruth you wasn't.
ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
oh, sure.
cause if you get in a bind--
no, no.
yeah, ya like to do things on your own  i been thinkin' lately.  maybe i wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
oh, come on, ben ,that's not--
-- no, i mean... we... your aunt may not wantin' kids and all... i mean we both...
when you won that scholarship, i was proud of you.
i know.
i'm always here, pete.
what the hell is that?
tofu.  ben, i wish you wouldn't.
oh, not that.  you promised you'd burn it.
you were adorable.  the least you could do is use a glass.
absolutely no class.
funny thing happened after my physics class today. harry osborn--
use a fork.
a match made in heaven.
see?  you big dullard.
no.  no thank you.  i have work.
i heard about thorkel's order--
i left a paper in my desk.
you taking extension classes, mr. jameson?
parker-- you go here, right?  got your camera?
yeah--
get inside and get pictures.  fifty bucks.
can we make it a hundred?
seventy.  but i want blood and gore.  you know, sexy stuff.
can't focus...
gimme that.  pick it up later.
poison emergency.
hi.  i've got sort of a hypothetical question.  do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
is this some sort of zen thing?
i mean, i suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
do ya? lemme give you the number for bellevue.  that's 561-5151--
yeah, a psychiatric hospital. listen, i'm serious--
now tell me you love me.
lemme down, bugface!
that's not even close.
are you okay?
get away from me, freak!
kid, you were terrific.  max reiss, novelty acts.  was that judo or something?  ah, skip it.  question is, can you do it again?
oh-- i don't know-- thanks, mr. reiss, but--
how are you doing, kid?
oh, look, mr. hogan, i'm really sorry about what happened in there. really--
you can be great, kid, just stick with it. but let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
right.
no refund on the mask, y'know. health laws.
uh-huh. look, this should be skintight.  bright colors.  red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
what's this? a cockaroach?
a spider.  eight legs.
eh.  week from tomorrow.
how about tomorrow?
you're making my life difficult.
two suits by tomorrow for $400?
an even five i throw in the jacket.
deal.  but don't tell anyone.  i want to keep a low profile.
a bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the big bang, kaluza-klein--
ach, theories!  this was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
my… self.  i don't matter.  this human life, all life- insignificant.  bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
all right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
you're wrong.  just for a moment, i heard, saw, felt-- i became creation.
creation? or its opposite?
truth. pure, eternal.  beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
otto, we are mere mortals. you must never forget your own limits--
i'll repeat the experiment.  i will hold the truth. that's the only thing that matters.
no. it isn't.
life and death matter. yours-- everyone's.  by comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
oh, roz.  my mind is so far beyond yours now.  i could beat you at chess now.
then you'll be glad to know the university has decided not to press criminal charges against you. breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
i will finish what i've begun…
doubtless.  and you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   somewhere else.
ooooh.  your feet are on fire.
harry…
"harry osborne diminishes the stature of the university."
let me guess.  the hunting dogs. you lost your scholarship.
"scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
i know.  i've got one too.
screw scholarships!   universities are death!  they make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  burn 'em down, i say!
great idea.  let me get some shoes. i'll take you home.
why home? the real world beckons, man!  the possibilities are endless.  want to go up to the world trade center and laugh at new jersey?
you're so responsible it's disgusting. but you're my only friend... do you hate me?
don't be pitiful.
i am not pitiful!  i am the bridge to the Übermensch!
i bet you don't think i appreciate you, parker.  i do.
well, thanks.  you wouldn't believe what i went through to get those. right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
i like enthusiasm.  that's why i use a lot of smart-ass kids.  not just 'cause they work cheap.
mr. jameson--
i got a question, college boy.  what the hell am i supposed to do with these!?  i ask for disaster, pathos, what do i get?  salvador dali!  when i want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, i'll ask for--
double-exposures? but they're not-- i was in--
i don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  i can't print this surreal garbage!
you print pictures of bigfoot!
bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  did you get pictures?
mr. jameson--
no! washington square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like a-bombs.  did you get pictures?
can i get a word in edgewise?
no!  now get outta my face, kid.
hello, uh, mr. reiss?  i'm-- i'm the guy who wrestled hulk hogan the other day.  the guy in the mask?
i was hoping you'd call, babe. look, you got representation?
no…
good. we'll make it oral for now. meet me at rockefeller center at six tonight.
why? it is a wrestling match, or…
letterman show, nbc. we'll talk then.  bye.
eat alone, gotta read. social defense tactic 17  peter, that jacket is foul.  lose your glasses?
hi, adele.
brrr.  it's colder than new hampshire in here.
i'm sure you kept warm.
sexual tension...
oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
don't misquote othello at me. besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
what's your problem?
i've got no problems.
time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
peter parker, you have no idea what i did this weekend.  or didn't do. it's no business of yours either way.
sit down and stop being such a child.
this from a girl who still plays with dolls.
that wasn't clever.  that was just nasty.
peter, what can i do for you?
an extension on that astronomy paper?  because, uh...
your dog ate it.
actually, i got this spider bite…
pretty lame for such a smart kid.
really, professor, i--
fortean phenomena.  anomalies in our so-called reality. weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
caused by doc ock's experiment?
how much do you know about it?
not a lot.  i saw inside of the science center.  what exactly happened?
only octavius knows for sure.  and last time i spoke to him, he was on the planet whiz-bang.
need any more help?
no, thank you.  i'm sure you've got your own problems.
where'd you get the clown suit?
like it?
nah.  the big mask was better.
is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
sorry. i'm still getting the hang of this.
i see.  so, amazing spider-man-- i'll assume that's not your given name--
just call me spidey.
can i get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
thanks, i already ate.
i'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
well...
all right, amazing.  are you quite finished?
just about.  you see, i also have this amazing strength...
so they're airing this tonight?
yup.  oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  solid, solid novelty act.
... a couple a drinks at sardi's?
what?
i asked if you felt like a drink--
no.  no, i-- my aunt and uncle. something's wrong  --  i need to make a phone call.
okay, kid. call me tomorrow.
mr. reiss-- i need a quarter--
i just gave-- yeah, sure.
peter, you're bleeding.
it's fine.  tell me what--
oh, ben gets through everything.
aunt may, what happened?
i was napping on the couch.  there was a voice and a shot.  i woke up. ben was looking at me.
how is he?
he'll be fine. they won't tell me anything, but i'm sure he'll be fine.
are you quite finished?
just about.  see, i also have this amazing strength.
jesus christ.
mm-hmm.
and you let me go on about rosomoff working me too hard?  i feel like a complete idiot.
you're not half the idiot i am, harry.
well, look who's dressing for success.
at least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
hey, guys.  check it out-- i saw this dud on the tube last night. he is incredibly cool.
i saw him too.  he was silly and obnoxious.
and flash isn't?
be nice.
yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
no, no, listen. they're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
flash, drop it--
-- but they got it all wrong.  any fool can figure it out.  spider-man nailed this guy!
peter-- you took this picture?
let me see.
mistake?  hey, guy, get back here!
hm.  what a lump.
you were the last one to see thorkel.  in octavius' hospital room.
so you've found thorkel?
some of him… char-broiled bones. teeth. we ruled out suicide.  any bad blood between him and ock?
octavius wasn't the murderer type.
but you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
waldos.
right. we have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. with the waldos.
lieutenant, i've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the bronx, jersey, brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  here.  the e.s.u. science center. octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
yeah, that's fascinating, but i'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
there's an infinitely greater danger. if--  listen.  the only thing octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  to do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, sl 270.
toxic dumps, huh.
and he'll need a cyclotron.  he can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  guard every nuclear accelerator on the eastern seaboard.  new haven, long island, two in cambridge--
you sure about all this?
i know him.
of course.
it's a lot of ground to cover. we'll try.  funny coincidence, huh?
no such thing as coincidence.  "god does not play dice with the universe."
einstein, right?  we'll see ya.
peter-- my condolences.
this photo you took of "spider-man" -
luck.  the right place at the right time.
really.  i'd like to speak with him.
i don't think i'll be running into him.
you never know.  go get some sleep.
i'll try. thanks.
what's in the bag?  garbage?
sort of.  i'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. maybe i can get my money back.
oh, don't do it on my account--
no, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  someplace nice for a change.
this from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
that was then.  i'm better since the lobotomy.
-- but at least aunt may's okay now. i really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
do you mind if i come too?
i think i'd like that.
they keep saying there's nothing i could've done.  that's a lie.  i could've done something.  if only i'd paid attention to my feelings.
you're not trained for that.  none of us are... i mean, sometimes i...  okay, let's say you had gone back. what then?  are you bulletproof?
well, no.
so?  the next day i'd read, "peter parker murdered," and i'd feel...
you'd feel what?
listen.  you think you're responsible for everything that happens.  don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  you're not the center of the universe. you're just... peter.
am i?  i'm not so sure.  i used to be sure of a lot of things.  oh, different things from week to week, but now-- i'm not sure of anything anymore.
i know what you mean.  i...
hello.  earth to peter.  are you listening?
unh-huh.  excuse me.  i've gotta go.
relax, jameson.  this is business. i know you want photos of me, so i'll give your boy parker an exclusive.  on one condition--
i don't submit to blackmail!  the first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as i imagine it, and--
would you cool it already?
police, help!  po-- mmph.
thank you.  now, repeat after me-- spider-man is a good guy. on the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
frmpph-yrr.
fine.
oh, that?  it'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. your mouth needs the rest.  bye.
hmf-hrr?
he left.  i couldn't believe it-- he just left!  it's as if he's somewhere else... i'm only getting a piece of him.
when peter was little, he loved to hide.  in closets, under the sink. he needed a secret place.  but when i'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
i don't think he wants me to find him.
maybe i was hiding.  for years, i never told ben the one important thing.
he knew.
some things you should say anyway.
even if they're not clever.
even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
what if you get hurt?
what if the world ends tomorrow?
i sent for  the police.  we can explain.
explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
right.  let's go.
you're sure you're all right.
yeah, just a lung full of new jersey.  lucky you showed up when you did.
logic.  lot 49 is the closest stockpile of sl 270--  i do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
imagine how i feel.
excuse me if i'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
the usual.  heredity and environment.  what's the deal with doc ock?
he'll try to finish his experiment.
and blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  bit egotistical, isn't it?
a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius. in  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. it must be very lonely.
forgive me if i don't feel too sympathetic right now.
i listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the bhagavad gita, the indian holy book-- "i am become shiva, death-- the destroyer of worlds."  octavius was...
bonkers.
loonytunes.  and yet...
just drop me off here.
do you... live around here?
no, but i've got this secret identity to worry about. i'll swing the rest of the way.
i see.  well, octavius won't get much further. they'll catch him and... put him away.  sad.  he might very well have the truth.
phooey on that.
you get mugged or something?
listen, i do appreciate your concern, but--
i got you a present.
flash, get lost.
come on, laughter's the best medicine!
i'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
just shut up and close your eyes. this'll hurt.
may's much better. she'll be out soon.
oh, god, i forgot to--
ssh.  i always thought she was a strong person.  she is-- but not for the reasons i thought.
strong...
her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. the strong part is… what's underneath.  the part she was protecting.  there's no reason to protect it... i think she's just finding that out now.
peter?
i'm here...
yeah, roz.
any sign of our friend?
nope.  maybe he skipped to rio. feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  are you absolutely positive that one at e.s.u. is kaput?
roz? rosomoff?  what is it?
precise equipment… such as waldos…
my god, otto, you have to hear me! the world we know will collapse! everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
truth.  truth alone exists. truth must be released...
you have no right!  this is cosmic suicide!
spider-man, be careful!  he's quite mad.
i'm not so happy myself.
professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
sure, in the war.  pull those cables--
up here, docky ocky!
no, no!  not there!
i was there.
see?
or was it all a dream?
oh, i need your notes from the classes i missed.
well, i've missed a lot of classes myself...
oh. well, hang in there, amigo.
the paper, my boy.  a solid b-plus.
oh. yeah.  thanks.
if you really apply yourself, you'll get an a next time.
hello, liz.
hello.  so very boring.  peter parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
i... i like you.  a lot.
hm.  well, i like you, too.  i like your aunt.  i like your shoelaces. i like--
hold it.  can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
why?
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
nah.
otto, i don't like thorkel any more than you do.  but he has got a point.
rosomoff, i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents.
perhaps. but every now and then someone pays attention.  you did.
good morning, liz.
how very dull, peter parker.
it's too early to be clever.
it's never too early to be clever. describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
huh?
fill in the blank: "i blank elizabeth allan."
i-- uh--
uh is a good start.
i lov-loathe elizabeth allan. abhor, detest, despise--
oh.  well, i hate you and everyone who looks like you.
i hate the platonic idea of you.
i hate people with alliterative names.
i hate--
i hate your relatives, i hate your coffee, i hate your shoes.
no.  i was lying about the coffee.
thank god.
you maniac.  you'll blow your scholarship.
they'll never take me alive.
what's in there?
a little bunny i saved from dissection.
harry!
mr. parker.
hi, professor.  what's up?
-- but the dogs treed him between huxley and kafka.
poor harry.  always desperate for attention.  what about the bunny?
back to the lab.  harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
he'll weasel out of trouble. again.
maybe.  i could have stopped it, though.
since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
my my.
yeah.  really gets to you if you let it.
i suppose.
you want to give them something, but they'll just buy more ripple. and they smell so... bad.
what?
god, flash can be such a jerk.
but you like that in a man?
you should write that one down.
"flash," liz.  you're going out with something that calls itself "flash."
some prep school thing.
does it have a human name?
eugene.  admit it, peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "flash."
i'd never admit that.
hurry up, flash!
what are you doing this weekend?
i've gotta study.
oh. maybe i should, too--

is this some sort of zen thing?
i mean, i suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
do ya? lemme give you the number for bellevue.  that's 561-5151--
yeah, a psychiatric hospital. listen, i'm serious--
now tell me you love me.
lemme down, bugface!
that's not even close.
are you okay?
get away from me, freak!
kid, you were terrific.  max reiss, novelty acts.  was that judo or something?  ah, skip it.  question is, can you do it again?
oh-- i don't know-- thanks, mr. reiss, but--
how are you doing, kid?
oh, look, mr. hogan, i'm really sorry about what happened in there. really--
you can be great, kid, just stick with it. but let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
right.
no refund on the mask, y'know. health laws.
uh-huh. look, this should be skintight.  bright colors.  red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
what's this? a cockaroach?
a spider.  eight legs.
eh.  week from tomorrow.
how about tomorrow?
you're making my life difficult.
two suits by tomorrow for $400?
an even five i throw in the jacket.
deal.  but don't tell anyone.  i want to keep a low profile.
a bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the big bang, kaluza-klein--
ach, theories!  this was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
my… self.  i don't matter.  this human life, all life- insignificant.  bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
all right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
you're wrong.  just for a moment, i heard, saw, felt-- i became creation.
creation? or its opposite?
truth. pure, eternal.  beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
otto, we are mere mortals. you must never forget your own limits--
i'll repeat the experiment.  i will hold the truth. that's the only thing that matters.
no. it isn't.
life and death matter. yours-- everyone's.  by comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
oh, roz.  my mind is so far beyond yours now.  i could beat you at chess now.
then you'll be glad to know the university has decided not to press criminal charges against you. breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
i will finish what i've begun…
doubtless.  and you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   somewhere else.
ooooh.  your feet are on fire.
harry…
"harry osborne diminishes the stature of the university."
let me guess.  the hunting dogs. you lost your scholarship.
"scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
i know.  i've got one too.
screw scholarships!   universities are death!  they make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  burn 'em down, i say!
great idea.  let me get some shoes. i'll take you home.
why home? the real world beckons, man!  the possibilities are endless.  want to go up to the world trade center and laugh at new jersey?
you're so responsible it's disgusting. but you're my only friend... do you hate me?
don't be pitiful.
i am not pitiful!  i am the bridge to the Übermensch!
i bet you don't think i appreciate you, parker.  i do.
well, thanks.  you wouldn't believe what i went through to get those. right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
i like enthusiasm.  that's why i use a lot of smart-ass kids.  not just 'cause they work cheap.
mr. jameson--
i got a question, college boy.  what the hell am i supposed to do with these!?  i ask for disaster, pathos, what do i get?  salvador dali!  when i want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, i'll ask for--
double-exposures? but they're not-- i was in--
i don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  i can't print this surreal garbage!
you print pictures of bigfoot!
bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  did you get pictures?
mr. jameson--
no! washington square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like a-bombs.  did you get pictures?
can i get a word in edgewise?
no!  now get outta my face, kid.
hello, uh, mr. reiss?  i'm-- i'm the guy who wrestled hulk hogan the other day.  the guy in the mask?
i was hoping you'd call, babe. look, you got representation?
no…
good. we'll make it oral for now. meet me at rockefeller center at six tonight.
why? it is a wrestling match, or…
letterman show, nbc. we'll talk then.  bye.
eat alone, gotta read. social defense tactic 17  peter, that jacket is foul.  lose your glasses?
hi, adele.
brrr.  it's colder than new hampshire in here.
i'm sure you kept warm.
sexual tension...
oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
don't misquote othello at me. besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
what's your problem?
i've got no problems.
time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
peter parker, you have no idea what i did this weekend.  or didn't do. it's no business of yours either way.
sit down and stop being such a child.
this from a girl who still plays with dolls.
that wasn't clever.  that was just nasty.
peter, what can i do for you?
an extension on that astronomy paper?  because, uh...
your dog ate it.
actually, i got this spider bite…
pretty lame for such a smart kid.
really, professor, i--
fortean phenomena.  anomalies in our so-called reality. weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
caused by doc ock's experiment?
how much do you know about it?
not a lot.  i saw inside of the science center.  what exactly happened?
only octavius knows for sure.  and last time i spoke to him, he was on the planet whiz-bang.
need any more help?
no, thank you.  i'm sure you've got your own problems.
where'd you get the clown suit?
like it?
nah.  the big mask was better.
is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
sorry. i'm still getting the hang of this.
i see.  so, amazing spider-man-- i'll assume that's not your given name--
just call me spidey.
can i get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
thanks, i already ate.
i'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
well...
all right, amazing.  are you quite finished?
just about.  you see, i also have this amazing strength...
so they're airing this tonight?
yup.  oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  solid, solid novelty act.
... a couple a drinks at sardi's?
what?
i asked if you felt like a drink--
no.  no, i-- my aunt and uncle. something's wrong  --  i need to make a phone call.
okay, kid. call me tomorrow.
mr. reiss-- i need a quarter--
i just gave-- yeah, sure.
peter, you're bleeding.
it's fine.  tell me what--
oh, ben gets through everything.
aunt may, what happened?
i was napping on the couch.  there was a voice and a shot.  i woke up. ben was looking at me.
how is he?
he'll be fine. they won't tell me anything, but i'm sure he'll be fine.
are you quite finished?
just about.  see, i also have this amazing strength.
jesus christ.
mm-hmm.
and you let me go on about rosomoff working me too hard?  i feel like a complete idiot.
you're not half the idiot i am, harry.
well, look who's dressing for success.
at least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
hey, guys.  check it out-- i saw this dud on the tube last night. he is incredibly cool.
i saw him too.  he was silly and obnoxious.
and flash isn't?
be nice.
yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
no, no, listen. they're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
flash, drop it--
-- but they got it all wrong.  any fool can figure it out.  spider-man nailed this guy!
peter-- you took this picture?
let me see.
mistake?  hey, guy, get back here!
hm.  what a lump.
you were the last one to see thorkel.  in octavius' hospital room.
so you've found thorkel?
some of him… char-broiled bones. teeth. we ruled out suicide.  any bad blood between him and ock?
octavius wasn't the murderer type.
but you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
waldos.
right. we have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. with the waldos.
lieutenant, i've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the bronx, jersey, brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  here.  the e.s.u. science center. octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
yeah, that's fascinating, but i'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
there's an infinitely greater danger. if--  listen.  the only thing octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  to do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, sl 270.
toxic dumps, huh.
and he'll need a cyclotron.  he can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  guard every nuclear accelerator on the eastern seaboard.  new haven, long island, two in cambridge--
you sure about all this?
i know him.
of course.
it's a lot of ground to cover. we'll try.  funny coincidence, huh?
no such thing as coincidence.  "god does not play dice with the universe."
einstein, right?  we'll see ya.
peter-- my condolences.
this photo you took of "spider-man" -
luck.  the right place at the right time.
really.  i'd like to speak with him.
i don't think i'll be running into him.
you never know.  go get some sleep.
i'll try. thanks.
what's in the bag?  garbage?
sort of.  i'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. maybe i can get my money back.
oh, don't do it on my account--
no, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  someplace nice for a change.
this from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
that was then.  i'm better since the lobotomy.
-- but at least aunt may's okay now. i really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
do you mind if i come too?
i think i'd like that.
they keep saying there's nothing i could've done.  that's a lie.  i could've done something.  if only i'd paid attention to my feelings.
you're not trained for that.  none of us are... i mean, sometimes i...  okay, let's say you had gone back. what then?  are you bulletproof?
well, no.
so?  the next day i'd read, "peter parker murdered," and i'd feel...
you'd feel what?
listen.  you think you're responsible for everything that happens.  don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  you're not the center of the universe. you're just... peter.
am i?  i'm not so sure.  i used to be sure of a lot of things.  oh, different things from week to week, but now-- i'm not sure of anything anymore.
i know what you mean.  i...
hello.  earth to peter.  are you listening?
unh-huh.  excuse me.  i've gotta go.
relax, jameson.  this is business. i know you want photos of me, so i'll give your boy parker an exclusive.  on one condition--
i don't submit to blackmail!  the first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as i imagine it, and--
would you cool it already?
police, help!  po-- mmph.
thank you.  now, repeat after me-- spider-man is a good guy. on the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
frmpph-yrr.
fine.
oh, that?  it'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. your mouth needs the rest.  bye.
hmf-hrr?
he left.  i couldn't believe it-- he just left!  it's as if he's somewhere else... i'm only getting a piece of him.
when peter was little, he loved to hide.  in closets, under the sink. he needed a secret place.  but when i'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
i don't think he wants me to find him.
maybe i was hiding.  for years, i never told ben the one important thing.
he knew.
some things you should say anyway.
even if they're not clever.
even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
what if you get hurt?
what if the world ends tomorrow?
i sent for  the police.  we can explain.
explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
right.  let's go.
you're sure you're all right.
yeah, just a lung full of new jersey.  lucky you showed up when you did.
logic.  lot 49 is the closest stockpile of sl 270--  i do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
imagine how i feel.
excuse me if i'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
the usual.  heredity and environment.  what's the deal with doc ock?
he'll try to finish his experiment.
and blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  bit egotistical, isn't it?
a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius. in  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. it must be very lonely.
forgive me if i don't feel too sympathetic right now.
i listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the bhagavad gita, the indian holy book-- "i am become shiva, death-- the destroyer of worlds."  octavius was...
bonkers.
loonytunes.  and yet...
just drop me off here.
do you... live around here?
no, but i've got this secret identity to worry about. i'll swing the rest of the way.
i see.  well, octavius won't get much further. they'll catch him and... put him away.  sad.  he might very well have the truth.
phooey on that.
you get mugged or something?
listen, i do appreciate your concern, but--
i got you a present.
flash, get lost.
come on, laughter's the best medicine!
i'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
just shut up and close your eyes. this'll hurt.
may's much better. she'll be out soon.
oh, god, i forgot to--
ssh.  i always thought she was a strong person.  she is-- but not for the reasons i thought.
strong...
her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. the strong part is… what's underneath.  the part she was protecting.  there's no reason to protect it... i think she's just finding that out now.
peter?
i'm here...
yeah, roz.
any sign of our friend?
nope.  maybe he skipped to rio. feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  are you absolutely positive that one at e.s.u. is kaput?
roz? rosomoff?  what is it?
precise equipment… such as waldos…
my god, otto, you have to hear me! the world we know will collapse! everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
truth.  truth alone exists. truth must be released...
you have no right!  this is cosmic suicide!
spider-man, be careful!  he's quite mad.
i'm not so happy myself.
professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
sure, in the war.  pull those cables--
up here, docky ocky!
no, no!  not there!
i was there.
see?
or was it all a dream?
oh, i need your notes from the classes i missed.
well, i've missed a lot of classes myself...
oh. well, hang in there, amigo.
the paper, my boy.  a solid b-plus.
oh. yeah.  thanks.
if you really apply yourself, you'll get an a next time.
hello, liz.
hello.  so very boring.  peter parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
i... i like you.  a lot.
hm.  well, i like you, too.  i like your aunt.  i like your shoelaces. i like--
hold it.  can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
why?
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
nah.
