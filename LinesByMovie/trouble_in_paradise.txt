yes, sir?  what shall we start with, baron?
oh, yes ... well, that is not so easy.  beginnings are always difficult.
yes, baron.
if casanova suddenly ... turned out to be romeo ... having supper with juliet--who might become cleopatra ... how would you start?
i would start with cocktails.
um-hum. very good. excellent!
it must be the most marvelous supper. we may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
yes, baron.
and, waiter--you see that moon?
yes, baron.
i want to see that moon in the champagne.
yes, baron.  moon in champagne.
i want to see--
yes, baron.
and as for you, waiter--
yes, baron?
i do not want to see you at all!
no, baron!  i beg your pardon.
thank you.
who?
the marquis de la tours. he was in the lobby. but i do not think he saw me. I am positive he didn't. thank heaven! ... but when i came up here, right out in the hall there was king boris of alconia!
the tennis player?
the tennis player. he saw me. he bowed. what could i do? i nodded.  baron, i should not have come!
but you came. and you must forget everything--  except that you are here, countess.
do you know king boris?
no--no.
do you know the marquis de la tours?
i would like to.
you would better not. he is really very dull. but anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. and the marchesa is the best friend of the duchess of chambro. and she will phone the princess de costa. the princess does not like me--but i do not care!
why should you?
but she talks a lot. and before this night is over, all venice will know it. and tomorrow it will be grand canal gossip! ... oh!
do not stop. keep right on complaining. it is beautiful.
you know, when i first saw you, i thought you were an american.
thank you!
someone from another world--so entirely different. one gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! and everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... and then i heard your name and found you were just one of us.
disappointed?
no--proud. very proud!
the representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, m'sieu filiba.
i had exactly twenty thousand lire. i had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
why did you let this man in, m'sieu filiba?
well, he knocked at the door. you see, i was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
and then what happened, m'sieu filiba?
i said, "come in." and there he was. a fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. he said, "good evening. I am the doctor." i said, "doctor?" he said, "yes, the doctor. i came to see about your tonsils."
the representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
no!
niente!
that is just what i tried to tell him. well, one word led to another. he really was a very charming fellow. so we talked for about ten minutes.
what did you talk about?
about tonsils.
tonsili!
so i said to myself, "all right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. no harm in that." and then he said, "say ah." and then i said, "ah." and that is all i remember ... and when i woke up, i still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
you are not safe anywhere nowadays.
but please, baron. we are not supposed to breathe a word of it. you will not tell anybody i told you?
you can trust me.
yes, baron. thank you.
that is hotel life. in one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head.
please.  when i came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. but something has changed me--and it is not the champagne.  the whole thing is new to me. very new. I have got a confession to make to you.  baron, you are a crook.  you robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  may i have the salt?
please.
thank you.
the pepper, too?
no, thank you.
you are very welcome.  countess, believe me, before you left this room i would have told you everything ... and let me say this with love in my heart-- countess, you are a thief.  the wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. i knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  in fact, you tickled me.  but your embrace was so sweet ...
i like you, baron.
I am crazy about you.  by the way, your pin.
thank you, baron.
not at all, countess ... there is one very good stone in it.
what time is it?
darling!  now tell me--tell me all about yourself. who are you?
you remember the man who walked into the bank of constantinople and walked out with the bank of constantinople?
monescu!
gaston monescu.
gaston!
you should be ashamed of yourselves. two men of your standing, always quarreling.
he started it.
but you are the more intelligent one.
that is true.
then why did you do it?
because i hate him--because i love you!
you should have more self-control. you were in the army.
well, he was in the navy.
your bag?
yes, my bag!
did not you take it with you?
apparently not. do not you know where it is?
no--i'm sorry.
but you saw it here.
yes, i saw it--but--
well, where is it?
good morning, major.
good morning.  i'd-i'd-i'd like to look at some cuff links.
nice day, major.
umm.
you are looking fine, major.
now see here, my good man. I have had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
i always liked him. especially last year in munich ...
last year? it can not be that long.
yes! do not you remember the day you took that chinese vase from the royal palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
and take the twenty thousand francs ...
right.
sweetheart, what day is today?
the fourteenth of may.
and tomorrow is the fifteenth. and the day after tomorrow--
the six--
we will go to venice, to the same hotel!
we will take the royal suite!
two fifty-three, five--
seven and nine!
and we will celebrate the second anniversary of the day we did not get married!
darling!
what?  i may lose it again? but i have not found it yet! I am sorry. goodbye!  yes?
so you lost a handbag, madame?
yes.
and it had diamonds in the back.
yes.
and diamonds in the front.
yes.
diamonds all over.
well, have you found it?
no!  but let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
yes...?
will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
that is it! yes, that is it! ... jacques!
still studying the vase. mariette appears. he turns to her.
where did you find it?
you know the main staircase in the opera?
yes.
then you go to the left. there is a landing.
yes.
then you go into the foyer.
yes.
and as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
i know that niche.
and in that niche, there is a statue of venus.
i remember.
you like that statue?
not particularly.
neither do i.  that is where i found it.
i do not know how i could have lost it there.  i was nowhere near that niche.
oh ... that is strange. maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
of course it is! are you doubting me?
not in the least, madame. but you see, it is a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
well--i am madame colet.
and i am m'sieu laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
well--how do you do, m'sieu laval?
the pleasure is mine, madame.
one purse--  empty. one vanity case--
but really, m'sieu, this is not necessary.
please, madame colet, i believe in doing things correctly. shall we continue?  two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- oh, yes, this letter from major--
oh! you did not read it!
naturally i did.
oh!
you need not be embarrassed, madame. a lady as charming as you would, and should, get love letters.
m'sieu laval!
but one suggestion, madame.  not the major.  i do not  mind his grammatical mistakes. I will overlook his bad punctuation. but the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  and one lipstick ...  scarlet number four.
what is wrong now?
with your skin, i prefer crimson.
too much blue in crimson.
that is what you need!
no, no, no!  i disagree with you completely! i tried it once--
what shade of powder do you use?
peaches and cream.
that is too dark.
do you realize i have light eyes?
but, madame colet, that is a matter of eye shadow. i can straighten that out in two seconds.
you see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. it is not very serious, but just the same we would better not take any chances.
just as you say, doctor.
thank you, major.
good day, doctor.
good day, major.
goodbye, m'sieu la-- oh, yes ... this is a rather delicate matter and i do not want to ... you see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
in other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
yes.
do not be embarrassed, madame. I will take it. i need the money. i wish i were in a position to ignore the whole matter. but you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... to make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
then I am glad i lost the bag! I will write you the check immediately.
do you know my first name?
no. what is it? tell me.
and do you know what I would like to have you do with that check?
what?
make it out to cash!
as you like.
eighteenth century.
yes!
early eighteenth century. i should say around--seventeen thirty.
right!
beautiful specimen.
it is beautiful. but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so i gave it to my secretary.
oh?
this used to be my secretary's room.
i see.  she must have been very happy here.
too happy. that is why i discharged her.
is not that wonderful!  you see, madame--
but, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at home?
you think that is too much?
no! not enough!  in times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
that sounds sensible.
madame colet, i think you deserve a scolding. first, you lose your bag--
then i mislay my checkbook--
then you use the wrong lipstick--
and how i handle my money!
it is disgraceful!
tell me, m'sieu laval, what else is wrong?
everything! ... madame colet, if i were your father--  which, fortunately, i am not--
ye-es?
and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, i would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
what would you do if you were my secretary?
the same thing.
you are hired!
is this what you mean, m'sieu laval?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into madame's personal custody.  darling, that means that on the second of june we will have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
and her jewelry is worth a fortune!
no jewelry! hands off jewelry! if we are broke--all right. i might pick up a million-franc necklace. but in times like these when we are doing a cash business--why take a chance on jewelry?
m'sieu laval, madame would like to talk to mademoiselle gautier for a moment.
very well, jacques.
you have had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
yes, madame. you see, i have to get up very early.  my little brother goes to school--  you see, mother is dead.
yes, that is the trouble with mothers. first you get to like them and then they die.
two lumps, madame?
please!  thank you.
may i?
yes, madame?
you see--  oh, not a word to m'sieu laval!
about what?
potatoes. he does not want me to eat them--  and naturally i do not want to upset him.
naturally not!
now. uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been m'sieu laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
well--uh--yes and no.
to me he seems rather nervous.
nervous?  um-hum. he smokes too much!
no, he works too much.  he is chained to his desk. too much detail. now, if you could take over some of his work--
so he would not be confined so much to his office--
yes! and he would have a little more time for--
for all the really important things--
right!
I will do my best, madame, even if i have to work every night.
oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! that is ridiculous. you go home as usual--five of the clock every day. now I am going to be a little bit of a tyrant--i insist. it will be nice for your little brother, too. five o'clock--remember!
very well, madame. thank you.
yes, madame?
how much is your salary?
well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
oh, madame, you are just too sweet for words!
you! and she is willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
what?
but it is not enough!
this woman has more than jewelry.
ah!
did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
certainly!
they are all right, are not they?
beautiful. and what of it?  let me tell you something: so far as I am concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
gaston. let's open it--right now! let's get away from here!  i do not like this place!
oh, no, darling. there is more sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  it is only ten days ...  eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
darling, remember you are gaston monescu. you are a crook. i want you as a crook. i love you as a crook. i worship you as a crook. steal, swindle, rob--but do not become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
oh, m'sieu laval ...
yes, madame colet?
has mademoiselle gautier gone?
yes--uh--
oh, that is too bad. you see, i wanted her to do something.  well, i guess I will have to do it myself.
what is it, madame?
i wanted to ask her to ask you if you would be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
oh, no, it is the way you lead.
no, madame, it is the way you follow.
no, m'sieu!
yes, madame!
well, the evening is still young. let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  it is only ten o'clock.
no, no, no! i disagree with you absolutely. that is the trouble with you artillery men.
now just a minute, major--
no, captain, i tell you--
pardon me, m'sieu, but i have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I am sorry, but i do not seem to recall the occasion. no, I am afraid ...
well--then it must be my mistake.  i beg your pardon.
but my dear m'sieu giron, I am having a tea party. must i be bothered with all these papers now?
I am sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which i think you should attend to yourself. and i, personally, would not care to refer them to--to--
to m'sieu laval?
madame colet, I have enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  i was a school friend of your husband's ...
i know!
madame, let me ask you: who is m'sieu laval, anyhow? where does he come from? what is he?
he is my secretary! i hope that answers all your questions, m'sieu giron.
you know what paris is saying about the countess falconier and her chauffeur?
jacques!
yes, m'sieu filiba?
you see--  no, no! and yet--  did i--did--now where could we have--
pardon me, m'sieu. madame colet would like to see you in the living room.
at once, jacques.  we will continue later.
madame.
will you be good enough to run through these papers with m'sieu giron?
I will be delighted.
and so will m'sieu giron.
m'sieu laval, there are several things I have wanted to ask you for quite a while. i understand you are from marseilles.
um-hum ...
you must be related to the lavals of marseilles.
just a second.
i hope you find the figures correct.
i hope so, too.
m'sieu laval, i have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
for more than forty years. so madame told me.
and i have known the lavals of marseilles for more than thirty years.
and you, m'sieu giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of this report.
examination! m'sieu laval, what are you insinuating? i have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. how long have you enjoyed madame's confidence? three weeks, i believe.
two weeks and three days.
um-hum!
are you insinuating anything, m'sieu giron?
no, not at all!
well, that is fine. then you are not insinuating that i am avoiding questions. and i am not insinuating that you will not let me examine this report.
i was only asking if you are related to the lavals of marseilles.
and i was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
i do not see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
and i do not see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
i am only insinuating that you are nervous.
nervous! why should i be nervous?
i do not know, m'sieu giron!
m'sieu laval, m'sieu filiba would like very much to see you.
in a moment.
filiba ...
yes--filiba! venice--grand hotel-- room two fifty-three--
five, seven, and nine--
yes!  now do not worry!
i wanted to say goodbye to you.
goodbye, m'sieu filiba.
but before i say goodbye i want to ask you one question: have you ever been in venice?
no.
you have never been in venice?
no ...  have you ever been in vienna?
no.
amsterdam?
no.
constantinople?
no.
you have never been in constantinople?
no!
but you have been in venice?
yes!
let me tell you, venice can't compare with constantinople.
but--
i do not care what you say! in constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
and harems ... ?
all kinds.
yse seven, eight, nine, two.  we have to clear out.  railroad station? ticket office, please.
he recognized you!
no--not yet--but--  two tickets to berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... right ... right ... leave them in the name of--don ignacio fernandez ... right ... thank you.
spanish passports?
correct. now the train leaves--
at twelve twenty. i know.  lyons two, four, seven, one.  two more days and we would have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
well, we will have to take what is here. a bird in hand is worth two in jail.
hello ... is this the spanish consulate? this is doa ignacio fernandez.  my husband and i are leaving tonight for berlin ... is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? thank you, thank you.  how long will it take you?
i do not know. fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I will meet you at the station--midnight.  hello ... yes? what? ... you found a handbag? well, you are three weeks too late!
well, see you at the berlin express.
by the way, how is your german?
grossartig--kolossal!
also, um zwoelf uhr.
am berliner zug.
auf wiedersehn.
auf wiedersehn.
yes, madame?
what are you going to do with my day tomorrow, m'sieu laval?
well, we will have breakfast in the garden.
um-hum ...
then riding together.
um-hum ...
then lunch in the bois--
together.
then a little nap--
how do you like my dress?
beautiful.
hair?
marvelous.
lipstick?
crimson!
correct!  good night.
good night.
good night.
goodbye.
no!
in doorway. he bows, returns into office; door shuts.
on staircase; from gaston's point of view. he stops.
yes, m'sieu laval?
madame has changed her mind. she will be down in a minute.
but you have an engagement, and i do not want people to talk.
talk? about me--about us?
precisely.
afraid I am ruining your reputation, m'sieu laval?
no--yours, madame.
m'sieu laval, I have got a confession to make to you ...
but incidentally, let me tell you, i do not like you. i do not like you at all!  i would not hesitate one instant to ruin your reputation--like that!
you would?
yes, i would!
like that?
like that!
i know all your tricks.
and you are going to fall for them.
so you think you can get me?
any minute i want!
you are conceited--
but attractive--
now, let me tell you--
shut up--kiss me!  wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
m'sieu giron is downstairs.
tell m'sieu giron i can not see him now. impossible!  and, jacques. dismiss the car! madame is not going.
yes, m'sieu laval!
i want you to stay, mariette. you have got to stay. you can not go now!
i must go.
I am crazy about you!
i know it.
i love you.
i believe you.
then why do you want to go?
because i want to make it tough for you.
eleven o'clock!
a man in love, completely shaken. he sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
no doubt about it--it's that secretary.
funny, the kind of men women fall for.
no color, no sparkle--but dependable.
the type they marry.
you know, I am not the marrying type. i like to take my fun and leave it.
nice suit.
like it?
smart. london, eh?
ogilvie and oglethorpe.
i thought so.
he is really not a bad fellow.
just dull.
insignificant ... he is a secretary, always was a secretary, always will be.
funny--the first time i saw him i thought he was a doctor!
doc--!
I am very sorry, but this is no time, m'sieu giron--
I have got to see you.
but not now.
right now! it is very important, m'sieu laval.
it may be important to you, m'sieu giron--
no, to you--m'sieu monescu.
yes, m'sieu.
and you will be out by tomorrow morning.
very well, m'sieu.
otherwise I will call the police
yes, m'sieu.  m'sieu giron!
what is it?
you have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. you must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  let's see--  you will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
what do you mean?
you say i am a crook.
i know it!
then why did not you call the police? why don't you call the police?  I will tell you why--you crook, you.
m'sieu ...
monescu.
m'sieu monescu!
just call me gaston.
are you insane? you have to get out of here at once! she may come back any minute.
what time is your rendezvous?
now, lily--
yes, m'sieu colet?
you have to get out of here!
that is what I am here for--to get out! i want to get away from here, from you--as fast as i can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  sixty-five, ninety-four--
do not you realize--
thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... i would not fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  what has she got that i have not got?
lily, you must listen to me.
shut up! do not make up any stories!
but, lily--
do not you dare lie to me!  i know you love me.  well, why do not you say something? come on--be brilliant. talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  shut up, you liar, you!  that is what i want!  this is real! money! cash!
when a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
on the night table.
but i do not want to be a lady.
ah, let me have a little fun.
please!
thirty-three--
no--thirty-five!
yes, gaston?
what would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
i would not say anything--i would act.
call the police?
instantly.
um-hum ...
but why talk about robbery on a night like this?
you look beautiful.
thank you.  seventy-six, eighty--
mariette!
yes, gaston?
you have been robbed--for years. and not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. and you know who did it? adolph.
adolph?
adolph j. giron.
and you expect me to believe that?
naturally not. but i expect the police to believe it.
why not? he is a thief--he's a criminal.
i do not believe it!
then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
it would be a terrible scandal, would not it?
giron...!
yes, giron! chairman of the board of colet and company. honorary president of the orphans' asylum. adolph j. giron--distinguished citizen! ... well, shall i call the police?  i see! you have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. but when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "call the police! put him behind bars! lock him up!"
i think you would better go.
ever had a romance with a crook?
i beg your pardon!
let me give you a little advice. when you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. it would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
mademoiselle gautier--or whatever your name is--i thank you for your advice, but i must ask you to go. you have got your money--
i do not want your money!
and you--
lily--
leave me alone! you were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  well--  she is worth it! [ you were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a handbag. you can pay a hundred thousand for him!]
goodbye--madame colet and company!
lily!
goodbye...
goodbye.
it could have been marvelous ...
divine ...
wonderful ... but tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you will be glad you are alone.
but it could have been glorious.
lovely.
divine ... but that terrible policeman!
goodbye ...
with the compliments of colet and company!
he bows, goes. door shuts behind him.
