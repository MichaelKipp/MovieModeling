where were you, jason? in the car.
conklin up front.
I will get the book.
no. there is nothing new.
you are sure?  we should still -- we should write it down.
two years we are scribbling in a notebook --
-- it has not been two years --
-- it is always bad and it is never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  you ever think that maybe it is just making it worse? you do not wonder that?
we write them down because sooner or later you are going to remember something good.
i do remember something good. all the time. i remember you.
I am trying, marie, okay?
i worry when you get like this.
it is just a nightmare.
i do not mean that. i worry when you try to ignore it.
sleep. sleep now.
i should be better by now.
you are better. and i think it is not memories at all. it is just a dream you keep having over and over.
but it ends up the same.
one day it will be different. it just takes time.  we will make new memories. you and me.
no... how?
the telegraph office.
but we were so careful.
we pushed it. we got lazy.
but you are sure?
he was at the campground yesterday.
so...
it is wrong. guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
that is crazy.
no. not this. this is real.  and he is right there...
where --
back there -- at the corner -- hyundai -- silver --
...but you are not -- you are not sure...
we can not wait to be sure.
i do not want to move again... i like it here.
look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. we hang there awhile. I will come back. I will check it out. but right now we can not --
-- where is left to go? --
-- there is places -- we can not afford to be wrong!
you drive.
what?
switch! you drive!
-- where? -
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
-- it is just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- i do not think he was ready --
-- hang on --
you keep going to the shack. I will meet you there in an hour.
where are you going?
I am going to bail on the other side and wait. this bridge is the only way he can follow.
what if it is not who you think it is?
if he crosses the bridge, it is.
there must be another way!
i warned them, marie. i told them to leave us alone.
jason, please do not do this...it will not ever be over like this.
there is no choice.
i love you, too.
tell me later.
I am here. so is donnie and jack weller. we understand you are using the full allocation for this buy?
that is where we came out.
it is a lot of money, pam.
we are talking raw, unprocessed kgb files. it is not something we can go out and comparison shop.
still...
for a thief. a mole. i vetted the source, marty. he is real. if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it is a bargain at ten times the price.
show me.
here?
now. show now.
this is everything? is there.
is there. is all there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
we need to get in there.
I am working on it.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. one of them failed. the fingerprint...  that is from the one that did not go off.
and the germans can not match it?
do we know what this says?
yup...  the main word there, the file heading, translates as: treadstone.
what the hell is a "treadstone?"
treadstone.
never heard of it.
that is not going to fly.
with all due respect, pam, i think you might have wandered a little past your pay-grade.
and what are we looking for?
i want to know about treadstone.
to know about it?  it was a kill squad. black on black. closed down two years ago. nobody wants to know about treadstone. not around here.  you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what you are doing.
he does. I have been down to the archives. i have the files, ward.
let's talk about conklin.
what are you after, pam? you want to fry me? you want my desk? is that it?
i want to know what happened.
what happened? jason bourne happened.  you have got the files? then let's cut the crap. it went wrong. conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. conklin could not fix it, could not find bourne, could not adjust. it all went sideways. finally there were no options left.
so you had conklin killed.  i mean, if we are cutting the crap...
I have given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I have shoveled shit on four continents. I am due to retire next year and believe me, i need my pension, but if you think I am going to sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. marshall too.  it had to be done.
and bourne? where is he now?
dead in a ditch? drunk in a bar in mogadishu? who knows?
i think i do. we had a deal going down in berlin last week. during the buy, both our field agent and the seller were killed. we pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that did not go off.  they were killed by jason bourne.
...ivan mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies, pecos oil. he claimed to know where the money landed. we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency... this...
...this is conklin's computer.
...at the time of his death, conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
do you know what his budget was?
excuse me.
we were throwing money at him. throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
may i finish?
conklin might have been a nut, but he was not a mole. you have me his calendar for a couple of days, I will prove he killed lincoln.  this is supposed to be definitive?
what is definitive, is that i just lost two people in berlin!
so what is your theory?  conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  the man is dead.
okay, cut to the chase, pam. what are you selling?
i think that bourne and conklin were in business. that bourne is still involved. and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin, it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever he is been hiding to kill again.  how is that scan?
looks like he is been detained.
who is going? us?
there is only a consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
then get a number, they need to know who they are dealing with.
mr. nevins?
who is this?
pamela landy, again. where do we stand?
how long have you worked for the agency?
me? four years.
if you ever want to make it to five, you are going to listen to me real close. jason bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. a week ago, he assassinated two men in berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
i want that area secured, i want any evidence secured and i want it done now. is that clear??
yes, sir -- ma'am...
I am getting on a plane to berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when i ask you where we stand, i had better be impressed. my mobile number is...
berlin!
I have already got a team there. i doubt bourne's in naples to settle down and raise a family.
you do not know what you are getting into here.
and you do? from the moment he left treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
-- kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
-- uplink all relevant files to kim --  -- and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone --
what kind of problems?
depression. anger. compulsive behaviors. they had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
amnesia?
before this? before bourne? no.
good luck.
you were his local contact. you were with him the night conklin died. you are coming with us.
I am curious about bourne. your interpretation of his condition. you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
am i a doctor, no, but...
are you an expert in amnesia?
look, what do you want me to say? i was there. i believed him.
believed what?
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
so he fooled you.
if you say so.
not good enough. you are the person who floated this amnesia story.  ever feel sorry for him? for what he would been through?
you are making it out like we are friends here or something. i met him alone twice.
you felt nothing? no spark? two young people in paris? dangerous missions? life and death?
you mean, did i want a date?
did you?
these were killers. conklin had them all jacked up. they were dobermans.
some women like dobermans --
what do you want from me? i was reassigned. I am out.
see, that is a problem for me, nicky. whatever he is doing, we need to end it. this is not the kind of mess you walk away from.
i emptied it.
felt a little light.
drop it.
front. use your teeth.
sorry. old habits.
you still should have moved.
i like it here.  last time i saw you was greece. you had a good spot.
so why did not you kill me then?
she would not let me.  she is the only reason you are alive.
what do you want?
conklin.
he is dead.
try again.
shot dead in paris. dead the night you walked out.
you are lying. if it is over, why are they after me?
i do not know.
who sent you to greece?
a voice. a voice from the states. someone new.
pamela landy?
i do not know who that is.
what is going on in berlin?
i do not know! why would i lie?
she really did that? told you not to kill me?  i had a woman once. but after a while, what do you talk about? i mean, for us. the work. you can not tell them who you are...
i did.
you called it in?
I am sorry.
how long? how long do i have --
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
-- take the back -- get another car --
i do not think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
and why is that?
because he is doing just what he said he would do. he is coming for us.
anything?
no. munich's a bust. he is loose.
are we locked up?
is it fresh?
it is got caffeine in it. that is all i know.
it is me.
bourne?
what do you want?
i want to come in.
okay, how do you want to do it?
i want someone i know to take me in.
who?
there was a girl in paris. part of the program. she used to handle the medication.
okay, jason, your move.
alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. under the world clock. alone. give her your phone.
call a mayday into berlin station. we need snipers, dod, whatever they got. snipers?
hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
my ass he does. you are playing with fire, pamela. marshall said nail him to the wall. i do not know how you interpreted that, but i do not think he meant repatriate him.
do not you want answers?
there are no answers. there is either jason bourne alive or jason bourne dead. and i for one would prefer the latter. and what about her?  you just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
what do you think? is he coming in?
i do not know. he was sick. he wanted out. i believed him.
alright...
see that tram coming around the corner?
yes.
get on it.
i did... jason, i swear, i did... i told them... i told them i believed you...
who is pamela landy?
you hear me? i believed you.
is she running treadstone?
why is she trying to kill me?
they know!  they know you were here. they know you killed these two guys. they know you and conklin had something on the side. they do not know what it is, but they know!
how do they know that? how can they know any of that?
what is this, a game?
i want to hear it from you.
say it.
last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national.
a russian?
it was pamela landy's op. the guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. i have not been debriefed on exactly what it was.
last week? when?
and you got to him before we could.
i killed him???
you left a print! there was kel that did not go off! there was a partial print, they tracked it back to treadstone! they know it is you!
i left a fingerprint! you fucking people.
what was landy buying? what kind of files?  what was she buying?
conklin! stuff on conklin!
why are you here, then?
please -- I am only here because of paris -- because they can not figure out what you are doing -- I am here because of abbott --
abbott?
he closed down treadstone -- he took care of me after paris...
so when was i here?
what do you mean?
for treadstone. in berlin. you know my file. i did a job here. when?
no. you never worked berlin.
my first job.
your first assignment was geneva.
that is a lie!
you never worked berlin...
no... jason... please...
i was here!
...it's not in the file... i swear... i know your file... your first job was geneva!... i swear to god you never worked here!...
so what is he doing? you believe him?
it is hard to swallow.  the confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? it is more calculated than sick.  what about nicky? she is the last one to see bourne in paris. she is the one he asks for. they disappear...
well, whatever he is doing, I have had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  i want the berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
sir...
thanks.
she say what time i should call?
the sooner the better.
i did my box work, but i wanted to show you before i showed landy. i came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. i mean, I am with you on this, conklin was a nut, but a traitor? i just can not get there.
what do you have, danny?
you put a four-gam kel on here and it is going to take out power to the building. you know that. what you can not know, is if it is going to blow the room with it.
and?
there were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. the second one, the one that did not go off, was down here...  first of all, this is nothing, it is a sub-line for the breaker above. second, why put the charge all the way down here? if you are good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you are good enough to know you do not need this.  bourne would know.
it was staged?
is it a slam dunk? no, but...
jesus...
okay. what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne. what if bourne did not have anything to do with this?
keep going...
something is been going on here in europe. and it is still going on. post conklin. who is been in berlin?
lots of people...
including landy...  she had access to the archives.
who else knows about this?
nobody. you.  i had to tell you, right?
show me again...
okay...
-- go -- take the van! --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
black coat, possibly leather. dark slacks. dark t-shirt.  he says they are going to try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
yeah, that will work...what the hell was he doing here?
maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
i want to look at the room.  check it out.
alright... take it down.
what?
this stays between you and i.  we finally have an edge. i do not want to lose it.
you told me bourne was dead.
there was a mistake.
I will say. you killed his goddam girlfriend instead. now they are onto neski. they are at the brecker hotel even as we speak.
will it track back to us?
no. the files are spotless. whatever they find, it is just going to make conklin look worse.
and the landy woman?
she is done everything i wanted. she bit on conklin so fast it was laughable. she even found his bogus swiss account...
anything else?
neski was a roadblock. without me, there is no company, no fortune. you owe me, uri. one last push.
one last push. one.
here's what I have got.  remember vladimir neski? russian politician? seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of european oil ministers here at the hotel. he never did. he was murdered.
by who?
his wife. in room 645. then she shot herself.
alright... i want you, kurt and kim to stay on bourne, track everything that is out there...
we are looking at all berlin outbound. good news is, every train station in berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. common feed.
are we hacking or asking?
yes. in that order.
and what about you, anything?
i wanted to kill him.
but you found another choice.
i did.
it would not have changed the way you feel.
it might have.
i know it is a dream.
you do?
i only dream about people who are dead.
god, i miss you. i do not know what to do without you.
jason. you know exactly what to do. that is your mission now.
sorry to wake you.
i was not sleeping.  you ok?
what?
they found danny zorn's body. dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
oh, god... it must have been bourne.
did he say anything to you?
no... it must have been bourne.
we will know for sure when we get the security tapes.
but we can relax. we tracked him. he is on a train to moscow.
moscow? what the hell's he going to moscow for?
do not know.
jesus... i, zorn... i have to call his family. tell them...
I am sorry, ward.
you are sure?
what? the tapes?
hold on...  yep. and abbott just direct dialed moscow from his room...
leaving was a business decision. we are both rich, come enjoy it.
what do you mean?
go to the airport. get a plane. I will have a brass band waiting for you.
save it for bourne.
what?
he left yesterday on the night train. he is probably just getting in now.  you will have to hurry.
bourne comes here? why?
sit down.
I would rather stand if it is all the same to you.
i do not exactly know what to say -- I am sorry.
'why' would be enough for me.
I am not a traitor. I have served my ountry.
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
why not? it was just money.
and danny zorn, what was that?
had to be done.
no good options left?
in the end, honestly, it is hubris. simple hubris. you reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
no. you lost your way.
well, you are probably right. i guess that is all that hubris is.
sit. can you...  [the chair. have the chair.]
i speak english.
of all the people in the world, you are the only one i have anything to offer.  that is why i came here.
okay.
it is nice.  does this picture mean anything to you?  hmm?
it is nothing. it is just a picture.
no. it is because you do not know how they died.
no, i do.
i would want to know.  i would want to know that my mother did not kill my father. i would want to know that she did not kill herself.
what?
it changes things. that knowledge. does not it?
yes...
that is not what happened to your parents.
then what?
i killed them.
it was my job. my first time. your father was supposed to be alone. but then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  i had to change my plan.  you understand me?  you do not have to live like that anymore. thinking that.
you killed them.
they loved you.  and i killed them.
how... how can... how can you be here and say this?
i do not want you to forgive me.
it does not matter. your life is hard enough.
you are a liar.
you know I am not.
you are a liar!
look at me.
i should kill you... if it is true you should die... i should kill you now!
i can not let you do that either.
because you are afraid!
no.  because you do not want to know how it feels.
i have to go now.
is this really happening?
I am sorry.
where am i?
ramstein air base, germany.  before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital.
oh, shit...
careful...
why am i alive?
are you disappointed?
thank you for your gift. I am sorry about marie.
what is that?
do you think you can read? are you well enough?
do not need it. i remember everything.
sounds like a threat.
you did not answer my question.
why you are alive?  you are alive because you are special. because she kept you alive.  because we want you back on our side.
let's give him half an hour.
so?
felt promising. it is a start.
