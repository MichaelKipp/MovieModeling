hi, betty. you are looking good...
thanks, roy, you are sweet... a big liar, but sweet. i liked your editorial this morning...
oh, appreciate it. i was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
yeah, it was great. really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
you know, elden, some people actually read more than just the classifieds...
why do not you go back to doing something you are good at... like that lonelyhearts column?  I will take a refill there, betty...
hey, sheriff. how is everything?
oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
...i meant your food.
oh, right... 's fine. thanks.
i thought you said the eggs weren't...
it is fine. mind your own meal...
you should get the order you want.
and you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  it is no big deal, betty.
why you always gotta embarrass me? i been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
they are just eggs, elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
...plenty
who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
mind your own business. you just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
blake, i can handle that transplant!
we need someone with the right kind of experience, lonnie.
even if he is falling asleep on his feet?
lonnie, it is a complex procedure. why do not you observe?
I am not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, blake.
no, you are not. you are a good doctor, lonnie, but you are not david ravell. I have made my decision. now, if you will excuse me...
so, call me when you --
whoa, whoa, whoa! hang on a second there, baby. why do you need one of the new buicks?
oh, you are there. you sound out of breath.
i ran back in to get the phone.
i do not need one, but it is kind of a special night, and --
what is so special about it?
what was that?
nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. look, you do not need a lesabre to go out with sue ann. take the blue corsica. I will see you when i get home.
uhh, no, we have not picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  he is out pricing banners... i do not expect him back.
"banners?"
you know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
need something else?
no, i was just... how you doing?
great. good. content...
oh. how come?
i dunno. job satisfaction, i guess...  how is things at the tip top?
they are fine... you miss it?
you must be joking.
hmm.  so, del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
oh, yeah, he is got things up and running, alright...
'kay, good. bye, then...
uh-huh.  anyway, I am thinking easter, 'cause i just fucking love pastels.
did you watch it yet?
sure did. I will tell you, if that man was any better looking it would be a crime 'a some sort...
yep. hey, i got a surprise for tonight. we are going to the starlite in style!
oh, betty --
I will give you a hint. if you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a jaguar...
honey, I am really sorry, i was going to call you about tonight. larry's got a lodge meeting. there is no way i can get a sitter this fast.
no... what about your sister?
i can not ask her again -- nathan, stop it! jesse, do not take that, hit back! -- i feel terrible, hon.
it is all right.
you sure? maybe next week we could...
uh-huh. no, we will do it later. 's only a birthday, right? I will have another one next year...
aahhh...  so what color is it?
what?
the lesabre!
maroon.  i stole it.
what?
he was not going to let us use it, so i just took it.
oh, i wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
yeah, me too.
sorry, hon. happy birthday...
i gotta go make dinner.
sure you do not want any salad?
no, i do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new buicks?
i told you. sue ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
she is not comfortable in a corsica? 's got air and leather...
i took the blue corsica, del. relax.
all right, then. actually, I am glad you are going out. i got something going on tonight. some serious clients, with real potential.
...like the water purifiers?
what?
or the vitamins? or the...?
hey, the fda screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  anyway, 'least i try shit, still got some dreams left... you are a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
i got you, del...
...well, then you am not got much.
oh, i know.  so, who are these clients?
couple 'a guys in from outta town. they want to see the new lesabres.
and i do not need sue ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
just knock it off, 'kay? anyhow, they are 97's, they are not even new.
they are new to us...
it is people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
yeah, i guess there is nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, del?
that is a skill!
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody is still got to block for 'em.
you are a hundred percent right. they rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
bourbon, little water, thank you.
beer, please.
hey... you got a fine one right here!
wesley...  your wife's a very lovely woman. have i seen her before?
if you ate at the tip top you did.
oh, yes, with the coffee...
yep, betty pours a pretty mean cup.
i like this. i like doing business in the home. it is cozy...  who is birthday?
ahh... my wife's.
what did you get her?
huh? oh, umm, a car.  so, to a successful transaction...
all right gentlemen, let's get down to it. i need to know if you are for real.
if we are for real?
you do not exactly look like drug dealers.
is not that the point?
yeah, well, i do not have time to screw around. i got buyers in dallas, houston and vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
we appreciate that. but you just poured me a drink, I would like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
fine. you got five...
it is a nice place you got here. real comfortable. sweet little town, fair oaks. you like it here?
are you kidding me? what is to like?
seems like a nice place.
it is, if you like idiots...
what do you mean?
it is a small town, man. i never should have left omaha. people here think small. they act small. they are a bunch of dumb fucks.
really?
you better believe it.
could you give us an example?
of what?
I am asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
i do not follow...
you are not a dumb fuck, are you, del?
no...
i did not think so. so, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. not being stupid, you are equipped to recognize it.
are we gonna do business here, or not?
relax, we brought the cash.
I am just curious. can not you give me an example?
all right... lemme see... okay, new burger king opens up. these assholes get excited and start lining up. like it is some five star restaurant. the place is mobbed. right?
hmmmm. "five stars," huh?  is that stupid, wesley?
no, that is ignorant. they just do not know any better.
that is what i thought.  you better give me another example.
jesus christ!
he is waiting...
okay, uh... the, umm, injuns're stupid.
"injuns?"
you did not just say "injuns," del.
the indians, injuns, whatever. they are always drunk and doing stupid things.
like what?
driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
let's see... around here that would be kiowa, kickapoo or osage, if I am not mistaken.
i... i do not know...
well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  so here's how this is going to work. would you take your socks off, please?
my socks?
oh, jesus, please... please, god.
...and put them in your mouth.
that is right.
stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
that is so right.
stupid is calling people in kansas city who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. right wesley?
now, that is really stupid.
so you see, we have totally different ideas of what is stupid and what is not. do not we?
you know, a hundred and fifty years ago you would have been scalped for that remark about native americans. right here where your house is -- you would have been scalped.
hell of a way to die.
it was not always fatal, wesley. we could scalp del right now, and he would be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
hold still, del, we are just talking here...  then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. it is amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
a mark, huh?
I am all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. it is a beautiful piece of irony, is not it, wesley?
it sure is!!
are you out of your mind? you scalped him!
you told me how to do it!
that was to get him to talk!  get rid of that thing, will you?
this is great -- just great! now we do not know where the goddamn stuff is.
he told us it is in the buick.
we do not know which buick, do we?
well, why did you shoot him?
i had to shoot him! it was the only decent thing to do.
hey, betty. are you okay?
I am great, good, content.  what happened to your arm, roy?
oh, nothing, it is fine. i just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
make sure it is elevated...
uh-huh.
you want me to make you a sling? it is no problem...
what are you doing here, roy?
well, i was worried about you and i wanted to make sure you were alright... and i guess i was sort of hoping i could ask you about what happened...
oh, that... sure, i saw the whole thing. it was disgusting!
my god... did you get a look at who did it?
yes.
you did? was it anyone that you...?
it was chloe...
okay, let's go... i got nothing for the record yet.
oww! my arm, careful!
ahh, what did you do now... fall off your bike again?
no, it is nothing, i... my piranha just mauled me a little when i layed their food out.
good god... they are meat eaters, roy, just drop the shit in there!
i can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. i do not usually go so close to the surface, but i was...
...you are so goddamn weird.  oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
no, elden, i need to...
you need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. and leave betty alone, she's...
she knows who killed del. elden, she said it was a woman.
it was not a woman.
yes it was. betty saw the whole thing! your killer's name is chloe...
I am tellin' you it was not no woman, roy!
jesus...
you think a woman did that?!
so, you think you are going to find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
they no longer live in tepees, mr. college graduate.
did you send anyone out there?
you bet i did. i got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
bad idea...
you just go write your little story, roy. I will handle the police work...
you better handle what is in this garbage can first.
i still do not understand how you knew del was telling the truth.
i saw his soul wesley. he was face to face with his god, and no one lies in that situation. but your geronimo act rattled me, and i abandoned my instincts.  never abandon you instincts.
i didn't. you gave me a look!
what 'look'?
that one look you got! i thought you were done, so i took him out...
i was not done, i was just sick of hearing him whine. and you did not take him out, you scalped him. christ, i almost puked, did i tell you that?
well, why did you have to tell that indian story?
what the hell does that mean? if I would told a ty cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
it is not here. let's go.
you just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
why not, it will confuse 'em... got to do something, now that you fucked it up.
i wanted to make a statement.
let me tell you something. in our business you can not put food on the table if your phone does not ring. the guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. they get in, they get out. nobody knows a goddamn thing. understand? boom, boom, boom. three in the head and you know they are dead.
...that's a good motto.
fine, I will get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! it is the only statement you need to make.
i questioned joyce about all this...
yeah?
seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol del. on a regular basis, if you get my drift...
...and half the other guys in this town. including you, i believe...
junior year!
anyway, so what?
so? ...suppose betty found out about them?
you said a woman could not have done it.
a woman can write a check.
so you are saying betty sizemore -- our betty sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? you are amazing.
's just a theory... just 'cause I am thinking it do not mean i like it.
how is she?
she is in a kind of shock. i see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
could i have that in american?
it is a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
so she did witness it?
oh, you are sharp as a tack, elden.
that is it! you are gone!
oww, the arm, the arm!
you just do not know when to quit, roy! you were jealous of me when i got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you are still jealous now!!!
one question, doctor, please!  you can not do this! I am the press, i have rights!!
that is right, you have the right to remain silent.
sorry you had to see that. you were saying?
i was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. i also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  any idea who chloe or lonnie are?
no... friends from the diner maybe?
well, you should find out. she keeps talking about them...
let me know if you need anything, okay?
are you and larry happy?
oh, i dunno... enough, i s'pose.
then you should treasure that... you got to hold on to whatever you got that is any good, even if it is only a little bit.
all you been through... i ever tell you what a good friend you are?
all the time...
well, you are.
something bad happened to del and me, did not it?
yeah, hon. real bad. you just get some sleep, everything's going to be fine.
sue ann, I am sorry about all this, but i just know there is something special out there for me...
mmmm. well, it was a piece of luck running into you, duane. i thought i was gonna have to take wesley out and hose him down. all he talks about is those japanese gals.
i like 'em small. when you are inside a little asian chick, it is like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
what part of dixie are you from, duane?
georgia. in case i did not tell you, it is cash only, gentlemen.
we can live with that.
I am a yankee, myself. massachusetts.
here's ghengis kunt and the demilitarized zone. get it?  they are korean, so they are pretty hot.
you know, it is interesting. the south lost the civil war, but they still seem to get all the glory.
huh?
jeb stuart, stonewall jackson, jefferson davis -- they are all losers in my book.
the fuck you talking about?
even robert e. lee was a loser.
he goin' crazy on us, or what?
did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in georgia?
really. and where was that, old man?
andersonville.  they did horrible things to men there...
del's dead, by the way. i sent him to the great beyond.
actually, i scalped him, and then you killed him.
he is telling the truth. he does not know.
should i kill him now?
wait. any last words, general lee?
what the hell was that, another statement?
well, no one ever spit in my face before. especially some cracker fuck.
you have to rise above it. the professionals rise above that kind of thing...
I am in a motel. has something happened to del? did he do something stupid?
betty, i need to talk to you... in person! where are you at?
if this is about del, forget it! I am not coming back!
godammit, betty!... who is chloe?
I am through talking now! goodbye!
what if the killers did not see her? you published her picture -- you are going to get her killed!
no, we are bringing the community into the effort to find her.
you are lying!
i spoke to betty sizemore yesterday.  that is right. there is no doubt in my mind, folks... she is on the run. whether or not she is mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
that is bullshit, sheriff! you think she is a suspect!
I would like to apologize for our local boy. he is been in love with betty since the fifth grade, y'see. he means well, but he is in over his head on this.
so how do we know that car's still in fair oaks?
we don't. but a '97 le sabre'll be easy to find if it is here, town this size...  he said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
maybe you do not appreciate the gravity of this situation. it is bad enough that we do not have what we came here for. it is worse that we do not know where it is. and now this.  this was supposed to be my last job. i already put the deposit down on my boat.  how can you eat at a time like this? i get nauseous just watching you...
i can eat because i know we did not kidnap that woman. i can eat because they are not looking for us. and i can eat 'cause I am fucking hungry...  ...relax. she is going to end up on a milk carton and that is about it.
i hope you are right...
...i know i am. let's just do what we got to do here, and get the fuck gone.
mrs. rogers? I am dwight campbell, with neighborly life insurance. I am looking for betty sizemore.
i wish i could help you, but i can't.
are not they precious?  ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. does she have any relatives in the area?
no.  well, her grandparents are down in oklahoma, but that is it...
i see. and are you in touch with mrs. sizemore?
no. but I am taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
her show?
"a reason to love."
i see.  did chloe testify?
i do not think she will. she is a slut, but i just do not think she is that mean. jasmine'll bring her around...
jasmine... do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
...and how long did she work here?
oh, five years, give or take.
hmm... you two in high school together?
are not you a sweetheart... no, not quite. anyway, she is been with us awhile.
but she wanted more out of life, right?
no... she just wanted something outta life. anything. and with del, she was not getting nothing. that is her husband, del. I am sorry about what happened and all, but that is the way i feel about all of this...
i see.  may i?
if it helps bring her back, be my guest...
thank you for your cooperation.  just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
...who doesn't?
what is the matter here?
i begged him to let me put that on!
he is a prick. merle?... you are a prick.
so you are into "reason," too? finally, someone civilized! I am ellen, what can i get you?
hi, I am betty. I will take a miller, if you got it...
shut up, merle... williams.
williams, arizona. about halfway there, i guess.
halfway where? you have got to come home. we have been worried sick about you. are you alright?
sue ann, i thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what del's like. how did he take my note?
betty, honey, listen to me. a man came by from mutual life insurance. he says you have got money comin' to you from del's policy.  del's life insurance policy -- are you with me?
what are you talking about?
tell del I am sorry. i left so quick, but i need to do this.
do what?
i gotta go.
betty! listen to me! del is ...
if that little weasel ever walked in here i would not serve him.
I would slap his face.
I would kick him in the nuts, if i thought he had any.
where you headed, betty?
los angeles, california.
and you called your friend, and she is telling you not to go?  when i went to europe my friends told me i was crazy.
europe? the europe?  this is my first time out of kansas.
i should call you dorothy.  when i left here i went straight to italy. everybody told me not to go. but i wanted to go to rome ever since i saw audrey hepburn in "roman holiday," and goddamnit, i went.
did you love it?
sure i loved it! it was great.
let me tell you something. i got groped by these tunisian guys who thought i was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and i got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. plus, it ended my marriage --
that is horrible!
no, he was a toad. even more of a toad than merle... i just wear the ring to keep the flies away. rome was the best thing i ever did, because i did it! and i swear to you, it changed me. I have been to rome, italy! i sat every morning at the cafe sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
i left my husband two days ago.
really?
I am getting back with my ex-fianc. he proposed to me right around here, so i guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
wait, i thought you said you would never been outta kansas...
oh. i mean, except for that.  yep. I am trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that is pretty good...
nice move. cedars sinai?
no. loma vista.
i s'pose his name's david ravell.
how did you know?
what is his real name?
dr. david ravell.
you mean... george mccord, the actor?
no, i mean david ravell. he is a surgeon.
piss off, merle.  so how you gonna find him, betty?
I will go to the hospital.
what if you can not find him? what if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was going to be?
like rome?
worse.
you made out alright.
yeah, but at least i knew rome was gonna be there when i arrived...
ellen, this is the biggest thing I have ever done, but I have got to do it.
you take care of yourself then, betty, and do not let anybody stop you...
to tell you the truth, i can not believe I have made it this far. it may not be europe, but i just know there is something special out there for me...
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
you think so? joyce says she is timid.
joyce was screwing del.
...among others.
I would say that about torches her credibility, would not you?
yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she will fuck up. she is an amateur, just like del was.
no, i see betty as a midwestern stoic type. ice water in her veins. a clear thinker. probably a swede or a finn.
a 'finn?' what is a finn?
you should read more. listen to me. i think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. she kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. then she sees her opportunity, and boom! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. these heartlanders can not figure it out, 'cause that is not their sweet little betty. hah! we have been tracking her for, what, three days and i already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
betty, betty, betty...
so what the fuck's a finn?
oh, for chrissakes. it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
like... us?
no,... like a worthy adversary, wesley. like a very worthy adversary.
what the hell do you want?... hey, sue ann, what is up?
we think we know where betty is.
ah, shit... do i have to hear this now?
i see you are sticking to the diet betty put you on...
worry about your own goddamn lunch!
tell him what you told me.
why do i need to see this? did he ask you to...?
listen! i saw 'chloe' and 'lonnie' on t.v. they are television characters.
yeah? well, she called sue ann yesterday from arizona.
she said she was in arizona, did she?
this is betty at twelve.
very graceful. perfect form.
betty was a lovely child.
and she always had such spirit! but, after her mother died...
would you say she was ambitious?
oh, there is no tellin' what that girl could have accomplished, and she never had it easy. never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
wise beyond her years, I am sure, and such poise, too.  very, very impressive...
well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
i do not like talking bad about the dead, but now that he is gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i would not have. and yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. and that is why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
what do you mean?
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
mrs. blaine? i can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill del sizemore.
you have got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. that is not our betty...
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
because it am not natural, young man.
what are you talking about? killing's totally natural. it is dying that is not natural...
of course, i do not know every doctor who works here...
dr. ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. you must know him. he is incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. he is being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  it is not true. he was set up.
well, i certainly would have heard about that.
of course, he is only here two days a week. he is also on staff over at loma vista.
...i do not think i know that hospital.
it is in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
really? you have just described all of southern california.
what are you doing?
he has no heartbeat!
you are hurting him!!
I am massaging his heart. i saw it done once.
are you crazy?!! stop it!!!
listen to me! if i do not do this, he is dead!
thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  what time're they coming?
it is not an exact science, wesley. he said they will be here... my houston contact has always been very reliable.
and then we are going to do her right here. right?
you are always so coarse... "do her right here." let's just see what happens, okay?  "i wish that i could find a way; to speak my thoughts on mother's day. there are no words that quite express; my gratitude or happiness. a pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; i would not fail to give her this. I would make her glad the whole day through; by sayin' 'mother', i love you!' p.s. i wish i could say this to my mother's face, but i can not anymore."
let's get out of here. we got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where i do not know, but i know it is going to be long.
betty would never dress like that. she is not some trailer park slut!
okay, thank you, goodbye... keep in touch...
...she's got class, and poise. lots of poise...
what you did yesterday was reckless at best. you are not an employee of this hospital! if that boy dies i do not even want to think of the lawsuit that will follow. are we communicating here?
yes, ma'am.
good. I am prepared to offer you a job. you can help out in the pharmacy until your california certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. is that totally clear?  fine...
you can start tomorrow. and do not say a word about this to anyone.  is that issue?
umm... yes. back home.
alright. oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... well done.
you do not sound like you are from here.
I am not. i just drove in from kansas.
so why did you come to l.a.?
i came for love. my fianc is here.
it is something i had to do. for david.
'david.' that is your guy. so, you staying with him?
no... i do not really know where he is yet. I am at a hotel around the corner.
man, that is love.
you can go get your stuff right now. I will walk you down.
no, that is not, i couldn't...
listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. so, you stay with me until you find your david and live happily ever after. okay?
i got this apartment with a guy.
the one you were telling me about?
no, this one was worse... i had to have the place sprayed when he left. twice... he was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I am trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I am on the street...
it is lovely... i really like your aquarium.
yeah, well, at least fish do not use your razor or pee on the seat...
hmmm. sounds like you have had a pretty tough go of it with men...
oh, i dunno... but just once i wish I would run into a guy who noticed the koi before my tits.
they said find it. find her, find it. finish the job you were paid to do.
half.
what?
they paid us half. they still owe us half...
there it is again. that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. that "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that is dragging this whole country down the drain.  they do not owe us shit, wesley! when you finish the job, you get paid!! we have not finished the goddamn job!!
that woman could be in any one of four states. four big states where the deer and the antelope play, wesley! we are not in rhode island!
i know that.
and turn that fucking music off!
do i deserve this? in the twilight of my career, do i deserve this? i do not think so! I have always tried to do what is right. i never took out anybody who did not have it coming. I am a professional!  and where the fuck am i? I am in purgatory!
worse... you are in texas.
well, i should be in florida now! if carl had not gone in to get those stones removed, you would not be here and I would be on my way to the keys. on my boat, relaxing with a glass of port!! re-ti red!
hey, rosa... it is betty. how do you get to this town called 'tustin?' it is in orange county...
tustin? take the hollywood freeway to the five...
the five?
just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
okay... oh, umm, would you mind if i borrowed some clothes?
huh? sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  we are still on for tonight, right?
you made it! hey, that looks great on you. 's classy...  so, how did it go today? you find him?
ummm... no, no. different 'ravell.'
you know, the more i think about it, this really is not david's kind of place.
what are you talking about? this bar is packed with professional people!  everybody says if you are going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... luckily, I am currently off men, so I have got the luxury of not giving a shit.
i know what you mean, i recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and david's still getting over leslie.  his wife.
he has a wife?!
had. she died in a car accident last year. she was decapitated.
god, that is awful!
it may not have been an accident. they never did find her head...
her 'head'?! you are making this up...
no, no! well, see, she was having an affair with a russian diplomat who i believe was mixed up with the mafia...
jesus, i thought my love life was crazy...
...so, we will hit the library first and fan out from there. they have got all the l.a. phone books, plus medical directories...  we are not going to let him hide from you any more, okay? I am making this my personal mission.
david is not hiding from me, i left him standing at the altar six years ago and now i'm...
fuck the details, they are always to blame... look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. i see it at my company all day long! so I am just going to make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  one of us should.
rosa, i can not believe you are doing all this for me... thank you.
hey, how 'bout a card for me? what is that?  "please call if you have any information on david ravell." this is my phone number! how many of these have you given out?
how many men have i talked to?
jesus! they are all going to be calling me!
you said in l.a., anything goes.
i was talking about what you could wear!
you do not look comfortable here. that is 'cause you do not like being the center of attention, do you? nah. you are like me.
what the hell's the matter with you?
that was a really shitty thing to do.
I am sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
what? what does she represent?! what could some cornbread white bitch from kansas who is dragging our sorry asses up and down the louisiana purchase possibly mean to you?!! I would just love to know...
i dunno... something.  why is she doing this to me? why?...
i do not know, but when we find her she is going to die for it.
how did they describe her?
you know, blonde, thin, whatever...
not so fast! slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... did they say she had style? a kind of grace or anything?
what do you think my father would do if i told him i did not want to be a lawyer anymore?
probably the same thing my mom would do if i got engaged... have a heart attack.
so how is it going with your new roomie? what is her name?
betty. it is o.k. except I am worn out. we spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. how can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
so tell her to settle for the old one in orange county.
she is going to have to 'cause I am out of ideas.
maybe we are suing him for malpractice. what is his name again?
david ravell.
god, that sounds so familiar. ravell, ravell... where is he out of?
I am not sure now. she said he used to be over at loma vista. i never heard of it.
loma vista?  you mean like the guy on "a reason to love?"
guess who i saw today.
who?
doctor david ravell.
what? where was he?!
on television!!  cut the shit, will you!
either you are making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. which one is it?!
i have no idea what you are talking about.
I am talking about david ravell!!
shhh! i heard you the first time.
i spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. i should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but i was with you.
if you did not want to do it, you should have said so! is this about gas money?
it is not about gas money!!  you have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! not the actor -- whose name is george, by the way. his character!
why did you help me in the first place?
i helped you because I am an idiot! ask my mother, i love it when people take advantage of me! i trusted you!! i thought he was real!
he is real!!
I am not going back on our arrangement. my word is good, and my family owes you. but i think it is best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
fine.
you are wastin' your time, roy.
look joyce, i need your key to the files, not advice, okay? this is a complex case.
nothin' complex about it. del's dead, betty's gone. she is probably dead, too.
you would like that would not you? you have hated betty since you were in pep squad together...
no... before that.
ahh, i hate this town! places like this just make you small...  i should have never come back here after college.
blah -- blah -- blah... hurry up, will ya, i got a date tonight...
i do not know what you think you will find, anyway.
names, a phone number, something...  listen, ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? if ballard was not such a stubborn ass, i would not have to be breaking in here...
what did you say?
the driver was killed. i think there is a connection --
no, about... are you talking about duane cooley?
yeah. why, you know him?
know him? we were gonna get married! he was gonna leave his wife for me! fuck!!...
come on, elden, think about it. the driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something is going on here!
i know that...
well, do something, then, damnit!
you watch your mouth when you are in a goddamn county vehicle... you do not think i see what is going on? del, now this cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with joyce... 's not no conspiracy, not some episode off the x-files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that is what is going on here.
oww... did you have to make these things so tight?
no, i did not have to.
hey... is betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
oh, yeah... man, I would love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
do not worry, I am looking... just taking a tiny break.
this is crazy. i come home, you go to your room. you go in the kitchen, i go to my room. it is stupid.
so what do you say? can we be friends?
...okay.
what are those for?
oh, it is a charity dinner. the money goes to a good cause, but i do not have anybody to go with...
umm...
we should go.
we do not have time to look at a hole in the ground. we can make vegas in four hours. this one's got to be her.
it is a very moving experience, trust me.
no.
one of the seven natural wonders of the world.
no... be dark before we get there. you wanna see the grand canyon at night?
what difference does it make? she was not in kansas city, or houston, or dallas. we went to every goddamn place del mentioned and no betty. so what the hell makes you think she is in vegas? you think she is waiting for us with tassles on her titties? vegas is too crass for betty.
i said, 'no.' n-o.
"when i grow up I am going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. i always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
do you hear yourself right now...? like a fucking madman...
every american should see the grand canyon. are you an american?
yes, i am and we are not going. act professional.
looking for someone?
you never know who you will see.
...of course you do.  you do not remember me?
i take it i should. I am sorry.
we were engaged.
i beg your pardon?
but I am the one who is sorry. letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  we were thirteen days away from getting married and... i just got scared. it is a mistake I have had to live with for six years. but it is behind me now...  and i hope you can put it behind you. I have missed you... david.
that is very kind of you.
the day i left you i just drove and drove. i drove all day and all that night, and i did not go anywhere. i just kept driving. i stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and i sat --
i can not believe i remembered that, although i suppose i should. i wrote it...  but that was seven years ago, and you are quoting it verbatim. I am flattered... i think. or frightened. what is your name?
betty sizemore. what do you mean you wrote it?
I am lyla branch. I am the producer.
alright, i admit it, you had me there. you are better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
no, wait... what happened next, betty?
are you sure you want to encourage this?  no, you are right, let's have some fun. so, what did happened next, "betty"?
well, david moved out here and started his residency. then he met leslie --
no, no, no. we know all that. what happened with you?
i married a car salesman.
oh, you mean fred.
no, del.
right, del. del was one hot salesman. of cars. he could talk anyone into anything.
you knew del?!
honey, i did not want to tell you at the time, but del and i go way back. we went to school together. in fact, he saved my life. two more minutes in that icy water and i would have drowned. but del jumped in and grabbed me. we fell out of touch eventually, but i still owe him one.
he never told me anything about... that is unbelievable!
funny, that is just what i was thinking...
i can not tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
i tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. but... del?
there was no plan! i was just young and stupid and scared!
you never gave us a chance...
i know that. i can not tell you how many times I have said that to myself in those exact words.
why do they keep calling you george?
i do not know. why do you keep calling me george?
right, uhh... i feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  but... I would be honored if you would come.
yeah, bring your friend along. I am sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
yeah?
mr. campbell?
huh?
is this neighborly life insurance?
oh, umm, yes, this is dwight campbell.
it is sue ann rogers, betty sizemore's friend? i heard from her.
well, guess what? i found betty... where she is been, anyway.
where? where is she?
I am not telling.
what?
I am not telling 'til you straighten up. you been acting like fucking jerry lewis on me and this shit's got to stop or you can forget about your betty... i mean it.
i guess we all did.  you know, i did not marry leslie because i loved her. i married her to forget you...
oh, david... I am sorry i caused you that much pain.
oh my god! what is lonnie doing here?
you are late, eric.
this does not look like the kind of place betty would go to.
maybe she had to use the bathroom. she pees, does not she?!...
lyla's very nice.
yes, she is.
she told me i was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. and she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
she is a good person to know.  so where did you study again?
carleton school of nursing. two semesters, but del made me give it up...
alright, okay... i think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
you told me that two hours ago.
i have not been this happy since i was twelve years old.
what happened when you were twelve?
for mother's day, i used all my allowance that I would been saving to take my mother to kansas city. we got our nails done and had lunch at "skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. it was the last outing we took together. she died the following year.
wow... you just gave me goosebumps, you know that? you make it all sound so real. great improv...
i just want everything to be perfect between us.
i know. listen, we need to take a time out here. can we talk seriously for a minute?
of course.
at last! i know how much you want this. you are gifted and extremely determined, but... it is not up to me.
i know. it is up to us.
were you with him this whole time?
oh, god! you scared me! yes...
you still in love?
does he know you think he is real?
he is real.
uh-huh... so, what did you talk about?
oh, my gosh, everything! my trip out here, what we have both been doing, you know...
no, I am not sure i could begin to imagine... so, where did you go?
to a party in the hollywood hills.
was it a huge place? with a view of the whole world?
yes. I would never been in a place like that before.
i have, lots of times. my mother used to clean them. i used to piss in their pools.
this is not fair, you know. do you always get what you want?
no, almost never.
but, you are in love with someone who does not exist. you come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
elden, let me out of here. now! this is ridiculous, i need medical attention!
that is a nice name for what you need...
come on, i have to get this dressing off... it itches! and what about my fish? who is taking care of them?
just shut up a second and listen... that, uh... that bar in arizona? where you said betty was?
what about it?
any idea where it is?
little place called "williams," why?
i just got something off the wire. the woman who owns it was murdered last night.  now, I am not saying i agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
i know plenty.
she makes me stretch! i got inside my character last night like i have not done in six years on "reason". it was a totally rejuvenating experience.
i know, george, i was there. I am not denying that she is good.
she is even taken a job as a nurse!  david ravell's getting boring, lyla.
we know that...
can i have an evil twin?
no, george, we have already done that with lonnie. the blind one last year, remember?
oh, of course. who can forget the emmy?  then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens.
i do not know, george...
I will tell the cast ahead of time. what do you say?
I will think about it.
it will be like live television! let's live on the edge a little. you and i can break the mold here!
i said I will think about it.
fine, but promise me one thing. if we use her, i want to direct those episodes. she is my discovery.
actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
hmm?
"would you like ground pepper on that salad, ms. branch?" remember?
...yeah.
so you believed the bartender. why?
well... i think i saw her soul.
that is good. you are learning. but let me tell you why i know she was lying.  first off, betty would never fall for a soap star. it is beneath her.
i dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
no, no, betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it is the biggest market for what she is selling. i should have known it all along. I am kicking myself as i shave here. so, first thing we...
wait, wait, wait a minute... that does not make sense.
what doesn't?
you gimme this bullshit psychic friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
i never said that i believed...
no, you believed her, we drove all the way to l.a. so that means you trusted her that much... so why is the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? huh?
'cause i just do not buy it. call it instinct. call it 35 years of professional know-how...
i call it 'nutty' as my shit after i eat almond roca...
you need to remember who you are talking to...
i need to get my goddamn head examined.  you can not rule something out on a whim. or because she is cute. I have been following your whims all across the u.s. of a. and now I am tired! me!
wesley...
"it's beneath her..." she is a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
...what kinda car's jasmine drive?
ahh, mercedes, i think. black.
yeah? the sport utility?
uh-huh.
damn, that is sweet...  she really that good-looking in person?
better.
oh fuck...
hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
sure.
are you sure i can borrow this?
no, please. go ahead, it is your funeral...
rosa...
well, what if this guy's just playing with you? what if he is lying about who he is?
you should have a little faith in people.
does he ever talk about medicine? his patients, the hospital?
all the time. it is always "loma vista" this, "loma vista" that.
rosa, so you have met david?
sure did! and a funny thing, betty, he introduced himself to me as george!
oh, he does that.  it is this silly game he plays. half the people who know him call him george.
i do not think your friend likes me.
she is a little jealous, i think. and confused when it comes to men...  so where are we going?
well, first i thought patina, and then the ivy, but then i thought of somewhere a little more romantic. like my place.
you never mentioned a 'stella' to me.
did not i?
no, i would have remembered that name. the only stella i ever knew was a parrot.  was this before leslie? before us?...
I have never met anyone like you, betty.
i know, that is why we were meant to be together...
no, i mean your dedication scares me...
it is easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
yeah, i felt that way, too, when i first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it is not all glamour and mall openings anymore. maybe i should have listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, i do not know...  ...i just hope it is not too late for me. god! listen to me, "me, me, me." it is so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. stop, right? that is it, no more about me tonight, i promise... let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I am kidding... seriously, betty, I am doing all the talking here...
...but i love listening to you, so that is okay...
thanks. but I would like to hear what you are feeling...
well, i just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. i promise...
you know, i almost believe that... you are like a warm breeze that is suddenly blown into my life...  i said that to leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
i remember. you said it to her, but it was meant for me, was not it?
yes... maybe it was.
who is this?
a doctor on the show... why?
what in the...  what the hell is this? you have been holding out on me. all this fucking time!
it just did not fit her profile...
fuck the profile! that is the same guy!!
she can not be here because of a... a soap opera. not a soap opera. that would make her...
...crazy! no shit, shaft!! and you am not far behind...
...but she's, no, betty's smarter than that. she would not be here for a...
i do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
do not  do not you talk about betty like that. i do not care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. got it?
man, you have got to get some therapy.
i said 'got it?'
...yeah, i got it.  come on, you are stretching out my vest...
you made your point...  i was wrong.
your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
ad lib?
in fact, i want you to ad lib, that is the magic I am after. i wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
betty, i thought this would be the best way. you know, throw you into it...
what the hell's going on?
if you need a minute, that is okay. but i thought you would want to --
david, i don't... can we talk privately for a second?
stop calling me david. we are on set, for christ's sake, you do not have to call me david here.
why are you doing this to me?
why am i doing this to you? is not this what you wanted?
is there a problem, george?
no! no problem, there is no...  what is the problem? just do that... thing... you do! come on! you drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
all right, everybody! that is ten minutes!
no! let me try this!
let me try this, goddamnit! she is been doing it all week, she can do it now!
i said forget it!
well, i do not know what you had in mind, but i hope you are happy. i put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you are making me look like an idiot.
what do you mean? what did i do to you...
who put you up to this? did my ex- wife ask you to...?
david, please --
stop calling me that! my name is not david, and if you really do not know the difference, you are more fucked up than i thought you were!
I am sorry... oh my gosh, are you george mccord?!
...what? what did you call me? george... mccord. you are my favorite actor on...
she called you 'george,' george.
...did i win some contest?
but I am david... i mean, I am not david, but she thinks i am! you heard her...  stop staring at me... I am not crazy, she is!
why are you screaming at me? i mean, what am i... why am i here? i don't...
you are doing this now? after all the... are you sick? are you going to kill me now?
no, i... I will leave. forgive me if i caused you all any trouble... i just, i do not know how i...  ...i'm sorry.
what can i do for you, gentlemen?
how do you do, mr. mccord. we are trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a ms. betty...
deranged. that would be the right word.
that will not be necessary. she is staying with a rosa something... hernandez, herrera. i know it is an 'h' sound... in silverlake.
thanks so much. you must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
more than you know. is there anything else?
no, that should be more than --
good.
well, are you going to answer me? what did you come here for?
i came for love...
you are not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'cause you know what that is?
it is people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
that is right. so, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
i do not know.
you sure don't. who do you think you are coming to hollywood, anyway? you should remember where you came from. and who you really are.
what are you doing?
I am going back to... i need to... i do not know.
...this is your sweater, right?
where are you going?
i have to leave now.
what? no, I am not going to let you just run out of here... you need to talk about what is going on...
you think I am crazy, rosa, but you do not know the half of it. my husband was, ahh...
your husband?!
yes, i had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. i was right there...
what?! that you had something to do with it?
i do not know. I am just starting to remember it now. i don't...
yeah, but your running away is not going to help you with all this...
there was blood everywhere, rosa. i saw it, i think i watched the whole thing happen... oh my god...
okay, okay, look, ummm... let's just talk a little first and you will feel better, i promise.
you were right. del was not lying.
well, you were right about what that bartender said.
what do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
leave. take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money.
we could do that. i could be on my way to florida, and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out.
...but that is not what we are going to do, is it?
no... if we do not finish this job, how are we going to look at ourselves in the mirror? this is it for me, wesley, she is the last one. my instinct says i got to see this through with her, and if there is one thing I have tried to teach you here --
it is to follow my instincts. and my instincts say get the fuck out of dodge.
no, i said to follow 'my' instincts. now, we go up there and conclude our business. case closed.
these guys are here to help you, betty.
i do not think so.  rosa, i did not kill del... they did.
not her mouth...  I have spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I have seen it painted on the horizon.
what is wrong with you?
betty! boy, am i glad to see you!
roy! what are you doing here?
you are in serious danger!
ahh, look, right now's not very...
i woulda' been here sooner, but ballard put me in jail. he still thinks you had del scalped.
sheriff, i don't...
c'mon, betty, open up! i got some questions for you about...
have you checked the trunk of that car you are driving, betty? i think there might be...
it is not really a good time, guys...
who are these idiots?
this is roy ostrey, he is a reporter. and this is sheriff ballard. we all went to fair oaks high together...
oh, this is wonderful...
...i s'pose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something.
no, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
do you know who i am?
...i... i know what you are.
do you know why I am here?
I have got a pretty good idea. you are here to kill me, so kill me. you want me to be afraid, but I am not. i do not care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
you really... did not have anything to do with what del was doing, did you?
i have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
so you were not involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  were you mixed up in the drugs, betty?
drugs? god, no! I am totally against drugs.
damn, life is strange. i had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- not that i did not admire you for it.
...well, if you are not going to slit my throat, why did you come up here?
...to see you.
that is a lie! i figured it out! I have been trying to tell this dumbass --
fuck you, roy ostrey!
-- small-time, pissant, barney fife --
shut up! shut the fuck up, both of you, before i kill you!
I am the one who watched the show... i was...
did chloe crack?
totally. she came apart like a house of cards. they dropped the charges...
goddamn... how 'bout jasmine?
she is a lesbian.
you lie, motherfucker...
i swear to god!
...i never meet people like you. I am a garbageman of the human condition. i deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. but you... you are different.
i am?
sure. you could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you do not even realize it.
I am appreciably older than you, but my health is good. i take care of myself, and i got some money socked away. you would never have to work again, that is for sure. I would treat you like a queen.
umm, i do not think that...
wait. let me get this out.  i like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. i read passionately, and i like to discuss things. I am basically conservative, but flexible. I have been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
"thirty-two?"
well, thirty-three, but I am not counting del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  you probably feel I am flattering myself to see us together.
i do not feel that, no. i just... I am not really who you think i am.
no one is, honey. here, listen to this... "if who i am and who i hope to be should meet one day, i know they will be friends." now that is beautiful.
i wrote that when i was twelve... where did you get that?!
i know. i borrowed it from your grandparents because i... i... it does not matter. do not worry, they are fine...  look, i used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in korea...  I have chased you across the country, betty, and i come to find out we are a lot more alike than you would think.
i thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
yes, but I would sort of like to put that behind me now...
we are in a shootout, roy! shut up about the damn fish!
you shut up!  they are beautiful, but get them some water.
that is my son! my son is dead!
I am sorry.
you are sorry? you are the reason we are here!
wait a second! i am not the reason you are here! i was minding my own business, living a perfectly boring life until you came along!
we need ammo... go check his jacket, I will cover you.
I am not going out there! let's wait for the real police...
you got to go, we are pinned down!
you wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. i say we wait...
no, no, no... you do not know shit about procedure! you do not send your best...
I have got the working gun, elden, me! you wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
if we went out that window right now we would have a chance...
i better go check on them.
wait, betty... you still have not answered me.
this is really awkward...
ahh, it is too late, anyway. it is too late.  listen, i could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... if you would gimme my gun back.
I would rather not...
betty, i do not wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. no way. I have got some professional pride. and i do not want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
...what're you saying?
when a roman general knew a battle was lost, he would throw himself on his sword.
did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
yes... not the actor, though, the doctor. i think.
so all this... really was because of that soap opera? my son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? a fake doctor?
i would not have put it quite that way, but...
wesley did not even want to come up here. he warned me, but i insisted...  i have to ask you, betty...are you crazy?
i do not think i am.
this story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. it is free advertising and it is going to run for months.
i do not think she can do it. you saw what happened.
you fucked it up. who would not freeze in those circumstances? and i do not care what her problems are. she would not be the first one in that cast with problems. we have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
what about me? do not you wanna know how i feel about it? I am the one who...
why would i give a shit how you feel. and i got news for you. i loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I am toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident.
that is not a bad idea. how many episodes before he comes back?
jesus, do not do that! if it gets around that you fired me, I will never land a pilot.
then do as you are told. get her back.
oh. of course... sorry.
my treat. you were saying... something about how stupid you have been?
right... i was. i was an idiot, plain and simple, and i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. how is that?
kinda like you would been saying it since you got on the plane...
i have... did it sound that bad?
mmm-hmm. listen, i forgive you, mr. mccord...
george...
...george. i do.  my best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
thanks...
...it's too bad you are such an asshole. 's the only thing that del was ever right about.
