you. tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue. a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. the civilian does not.
the exact words of the text. but do you understand it ? do you believe it ?
uh, i don't know.
of course you don't. i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
good for you.
your turn...
you still haven't kissed her yet ? don't lie.
what's the hurry ?
others are waiting.
did you read her mind ?
don't have to... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
yeah, but i want carmen.
you got it bad.
she's flying starships !
who ?
marco's sister. can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... you gotta have nerves of steel ! reflexes are critical
i have good reflexes.
eeuch !
aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
excuse me...!
35% on the math final !  no one could be that dumb with numbers.
well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. how embarassing.
who cares about bugs ? you can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
don't be so sure. i like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
i don't want everyone to see.
why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
how come that's all you talk about anymore ?
it's all i think about anymore.
you can't walk me home.
why not ?
i thought you were going to help carl.
carl can wait.
johnny, my dad's home today.
what's he got against me... i mean, i 'm a teenager. you can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
it's not you, johnny. your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. he's a veteran.
well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
sometimes i do what i want, eh ?
don't think about it... go on instinct.
ace of spades.
statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
in addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves i'm unlucky ? two of hearts.
how do you make him do that ?
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. he is going to go eat it.
ten of clubs. you still gonna sign up for starside r&d ?
passport to the universe. who wouldn't want that ?
i've been thinking about applying for federal service, too. fleet, maybe.
your father will never let you.
i'm eighteen. it's my decision, i think i'd make a pretty good pilot. i've good great reflexes. you need that for maneuvering, you know.
only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. so what do you think your chances are ?
eight point... no, uh, seven...
if you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
all i know is carmen's going to be a citizen, and i don't think it'll work out for us if i'm not.
love... how excruciatingly pathetic. now try and pay attention.
a lot can happen in three minutes.
hut... hut !
are you alright ?
i'm getting better.
so what are you doing later ?
everyone is going to the dance. aren't you ?
i don't know. it's my last night as acivilian. i ship out for tereshkova tomorrow.
i'm all ears.
don't you have to finish the game ?
don't get any ideas. she's my girl.
you can never be sure.
what ?
you were drifting. flip six, three hole. on one, got it ?
just throw me the ball, diz.
who said you could grow up so fast ? last time i checked you were only five years old. you had such a bright little face...
aw, don't get mushy.
this came for you today. i presume on your request.
a lot of my friends are doing federal service...
have you lost you lost your mind ? i'd rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life.
it's aterm of service, not a career. i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years.
johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the federal service. if something happened to you i don't know what i would do...
who gave you this idea ? it's that teacher. what's his name ? you know the one i mean.
mr. rasczak.
rasczak... silly name. there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
no, mr. rasczak doesn't do that at all. he sorta discourages you really.
good, because you're going to harvard, and that's the end of it.
i'm eighteen. it's my decision.
oh, is that how it is ?
wait you two. dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this. can you guess what it is ?
uh, no.
a trip to the outer rings. whad'ya think of that ?
wow ! santori and zegema beach, i've always wanted to go there.
good good, then it's all settled.
a year at harvard and you'll  see this "federal service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
wait a minute ! carl is doing his federal and he isn't inferior. he's the smartest kid at school !
sorry. carl's a fine boy...
i don't know what they teach at harvard, but i think i'm pretty good enough the way i am !
johnny, please. calm yourself.
well, that's what you're saying ! you're saying that i'm not good enough the way i am now !
why did you go and do that ? he was all ready to go zegema beach !
teenagers !
hey, rico, wanna dance ?
actually, diz, i promised carmen...
too bad for her if she's not around.
you still gonna play for brazil ?
looks like, unless tokyo lets me start.
well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
how come we never got together ?
can't we just be friends, diz ?
sure.
uh, look, diz...
guess you gotta go.
you're the best.
isn't it great to be in love ?
how do i know if this is love ?
it wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
aw, you're in love with me... you just dont know it yet.
wait, i want to talk to mr. rasczak.
i'll meet you outside.
mister rasczak ?
what is it, rico ?
i just wanted to say thanks 'cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year.
well, it's not really my job to please. hope you learned something.
i wanna join up, mr. rasczak. i think i have what it take to be a citizen.
good for you. go find out.
well, my parents are against it, and i know it's my choice, but i was wondering... what would you do if you were me ?
figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. use that freedom. make your own choice, rico.
johnny, this is zander.
yeah, we know each other from the game. no hard feeling, eh, chum ?
none at all... we won.
good luck at the academy.
he just got accepted to the fleet academy. isn't that great ?
yeah, sure, i guess.
no, i mean if he can get in, maybe i have a chance.
what are you talking about ? we both know you're gonna be a pilot.
zander is going for pilot, too.
you two have so much in common.
johnny rico, you're jealous !
i can't help it.
he's nothing like you.
i don't even know if you're my girl.
are you the boy for me ?
i'm gonna do it, carmen. i'm gonna sign up for federal service.
everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
who cares ?
you're right. let's never stop...
i love you, carmen.
shhh...
no talking please. i'm going to ask you some questions. please answer all questions truthfully. we'll know if you don't. birthplace ?
here in buenos aires.
are your parents currently citizens ?
no, sir.
which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
courage, i guess.
please complete this sentence. i want to be citizen because...
i want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
i wonder where carl is. you don't suppose...?
naw, i made it, carl made it.
he was in the group with me. i guess he didn't...
shhh ! don't make him feel worse.
hey, carl, what's wrong ?
did you get starside r&d ?
i don't believe it !
i got games & theory.
games & theory ? that's military intelligence... oh, carl !
whoa ! way to go, boy-yo !
let's all make a vow. let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
i'll go for that.
you'll resign, and that's all there is to it. it might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
i won't quit !
i'm telling you, you will ! you're not going back. you're going to go on vacation !
i'm not going on vacation ! i want to be acitizen ! it's my decision. i made it.
...cut off !
johnny, why won't you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
well, yeah, sure...
i hope so. i hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
you're late.
my dad had to help me pack. suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. it was sweet, but it took forever. anyway, i guess i'm ready to go.
poor boy. i'm sorry your parents were so mad.
who cares ! the federation'll give me everything i need for the next two years, right ?
you talk to carl ?
he left this morning. he couldn't say where.
i'm gonna miss you.
i'll miss you, too, johnny.
i love you.
com'on, just say it. try it on for size.
alright, i love you.
do you mean it ?
i said it. isn't that enough ? don't forget to write !
you got some guts for a rich kid. i guess you and me could be buddies.
what an honor...
hey, don't laugh. everyone oughta have a friend like me !
hey, amigo, come chow with me.
no thanks, diz.
what's your malfunction, rico ?
you are. i joined up to get out on my own. and you had to tag along.
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?
you saying you didn't ?
what makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, rico ?
something... i've got...you don't.
you rich kids... are all the same !
it isn't about rich... it's about who's best...!
wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
oh, yeah ? i don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
well, maybe you better look again.
our love will grow, dear, year by year...
bye ! write me ! i'm gonna kill you guys !
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
take the number one chair, ibanez. follow all instructions of you supervisor.
yes, ma'am !
hey ! what are you doing here ?
i'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
assistant insructor... you must be some kind of a hot stick. should i call you "sir" ?
only when i give you an order.
it's amazing, us running into each other like this. maybe it's fate.
maybe not. i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. when it turned out it was you, i made sure we'd run into each other...
alright, take her out, ibanez.
yes, ma'am.
in simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
this isn't simulation anymore. take'er out easy, cadet.
oh, yes, sir. vector ?
twenty-five by five, roll seven. and don't exceed port speed.
or...?
they revoke our flight status.
oh, i see... teamwork.
steady as she goes, number one. prepare for warp. number two, design for jupiter orbit.
yes, ma'am. star drive in three... two... one...
man, they're defended... no way in.
flip six, three hole.
what ?
high school... remember ? run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
cover me.
you got it.
smith, go ! mcintire, go ! flores, go ! rico, i'm making you sqaud leader !
sir, thank you, sir !
don't stand there dumb... go !
shhhh...!
i'm glad you're doing so well. if they haven't made you squad leader by now, i'm sure you will.
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
it's what i deserve.
whad'ya talkin  about ?
i joined up for her. i wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. i'm a fool.
you made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
sir, yes, sir !
rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
sir, yes, sir. breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and i asked him to show it to me, sir.
are you rated to repair a marauder power suit, rico ?
sir, no, sir.
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
sir, i needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... i... i wanted to win, sir.
do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
sir... i guess i do, sir.
thanks. you read my mind. third watch always seems to last forever.
oh, i don't know... depends on who you are spending it with.
profile's wrong... there.
no, i replotted the course. it's more efficient this way.
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
hey, check it.
you know i was talking to captain, deladier, and she said...
don't change the subject. am i right ?
well, whad'ya know...
don't mess with the boss. so what'd the captain say ?
she got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. she thinks we're good together.
you and me, huh ?
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet...
me, too... day and night-cycle.
report.
captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
where is it ?
there !	gravity field... it's big !
it looks like an... asteroid.
where'd it come from ?
trajectory indicates it came out of the arachnid quarantine zone.
number 4, contact fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
good work, number 1. you'll do.
thank you, ma'am.
it stinks, you goin.
i don't stay where i'm not wanted.
if they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! i'm just supposed to take it, huh ? well, i'm not gonna, and i guess that proves i just can't cut it.
hello... oh, johnny...!
hi, mom.
bill... pick up... it's johnny ! you little rat. you haven't called, you haven't written. it's been so lonely here without you...
well, it's just good to hear from you. what's up, son ?
it's not really working out for me here, dad. i was thinking... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home.
well, of course you should come home immedietly !
i've made a mess of things. i've been so stupid...
don't talk like that. get yourself home as fast as you can.
we'll all have dinner. i'll fix your favorite.
yeah ! we'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
oh, my, what's that ?
looks like rain.
this time of the year...?
well, see ya.
you take the stroll down washout lane, you're only proving one thing, johnny.
what's that, diz ?
that you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
sir, i wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
sorry, son. i can't do it. you signed the 1240/a. it would be illegal.
sir, i know it was wrong. i didn't learn from one mistake and i made another, sir.  sir, my family... my whole family was in buenos aires, sir.
is that your signature, rico ?
sir, yes it is, sir.
doesn't look like it to me.
i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
what do i want with a scar ?
what happened to your hair ?
what do you think ? everyone did it when we got our wings. you don't like it, do you ?
it's alright, i guess. you hear from anyone made it out of b.a. alive ?
it's funny. sometimes i forget. then it hits me, and i can't stop crying.
i try just to be happy i'm still alive.
you don't look very happy to see me.
should i be ?
johnny... life is so different from the way it was. one day you'll see what i did was best for both of us.
everything coposetic, lieutenant ?
zander, you remember johnny ? zander and i are a flight team now.
best in the fleet !
i get it. this is the part that's best for both of us. don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
johnny, wait...
forget it, carmen. the mobile infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
you got something to say about the mobile infantery ?
you heard me. wanna make something out of it, private ?
not with an officer, no, sir. the m.i. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
let's disregaed rank... everybody hear that ? rank is not an issue here.
zander, please... let's go !
what's wrong with you ?
hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
no, this hurts.
yaaaaaaaa !
mobile infantery rules !
death to all bugs !
plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
bug batteries... according to military intelligence, it'll be random and light. drop status ?
this isn't random or light. someone made amistake...!
that's it, we're empty ma'am !
lieutenant's bought the farm. where's the sarge...?
i didn't see him !
i was thinking. maybe we should get married, carmen.
you weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
if we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
there's a war on. i want a command, i want my own ship, you do, too...
so ?
so who's got time to get married ?
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. you'd probably get a promotion out of it.
funny...
i'm not kidding. marriage is -
no, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
carmen...?
excuse me...!
i'm sorry, carmen.
please, i... everybody's lost someone by now. this shouldn't be any different...
no, i... oh, zander, i'm a fool.
you're upset, that's alright.
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires...
he was our teacher... he was great.
yeah, well, i hear he's a real nutbuster.
seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  you top kick ?
are you kidding ? they always get killed. you want the job ?
i wouldn't mind.
i always wanted to go to zegema beach.
good luck. it's not there anymore.
where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
uni high tigers, sir. don't you remember ? i was captain of the team.
i'm not interested in nostalgia, rico, i need a corporal. you're it until you're dead or i find someone better.
way to go, amigo !
i'm gonna need a squad leader.
no way. big k taught me i ain't executive material.
what about it, diz ?
we must be right over the colony. let's get some air support, eh ?
yes, sir ! fleet, this is roughneck patrol, over ...?
corporal, i want pulse cannons there and there ! rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... they'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
they'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. who's got the nuke ?
you knew the lieutenant before the war... what was he like ?
he was a teacher , kind of a know it all... always had this little smile.
geez, i don't think i've ever seen him smile.
must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
all dead except one, sir.
kill the bitch.
yes, sir.
c'mon...
nah, i don't do that anymore...
you used to dance...
i said no. want me to pull rank ?
well, excuse me, sir...
yopu asked me some advice once, rico. want some now ?
yes, sir...
never pass up a good thing, eh ?
hey, diz...
what ?
at 0821 we received a distress call from planet p, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p.
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. that's why micom wants onsite assessment.
sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
take your group down to p and have a look see. leave the thinking to us, lieutenant. that's not your job.
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
bugs don't lay traps... they aren't intelligent ! unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
corporal, the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately. get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics.
yes, sir !
who's that with you ?
planet p ? what kind of name is that ?
they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
i don't understand it, lieutenant. it's not getting anything from 4th brigade... not even their transponder.
keep trying, sergeant.
gillespie, put in call for retrieval. we're off this rock. gillespie, do you read me ?
aaaaaaaaaaa !
rico, you're acting sergeant now. my last sergeant lost the com pack. put together a search team and find the radio shack. we need retrieval.
yes, sir.
diz, see what you can do.
i'm on it !
what's that look like to you, rico ?
looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
warm it all up ! everything you got ! levy, collect the big guns from the towers. watkins, put general owen with the wounded. rico, where's my communications ?
what's going on, diz ?
what frequency ?
all bands.
roughneck patrol to battle group... roughneck patrol to battle group...
this is rodger young... what's going on down there ? we're taking plasma ! we have orion p-11 as clear !
shut up, sir ! we need pick up now !
what is your position ?
landing zone is extremely hostile. come down on this transmission !
inside 4th brigade compound ? that's crazy !
then i hope you have a crazy pilot ! keep the line open, dizzy !
jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
not enough, i guess.
sergeant, secure the boat !
yes, sir !
aaaaaaaaaaaa !
cover us, ace !
hit your jets, sir !
i can't my legs are gone... get on the boat...
rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. i've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
we're not leaving you here, sir !
this is my farm. get on the boat, now ! that's an order, sergeant.
give'em hell, sir !
i bought the farm, didn't i, johnny ?
no, you're gonna be alright, diz !
it's alright 'cause i got to have you, johnny...
on whose authority, corporal ?
this would be mine, sir. acting sergeant john rico. i've assumed command on this mission.
johnny...! i thought you were dead !
i'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. glass the planet !
...i'm sorry.
we gotta choke on the mud and the blood and fleet can't be bothered to spit.
no, i think something's up. the sky marshall's here.
i thought you were kia, johnny...
that was just a mix up.
you look so... i don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
what happened to your eye ?
almost got knocked out of the sky over big k.
i like it. it's kinda...you.
where are you going ?
a funeral.
that girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
yeah.
how do you feel about him now ?
i don't know, zander.
i do.
please continue, sergeant.
dizzy wouldn't want our tears. she'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. so go out and kill a bug for dizzy. kill as many as you can. you are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
well, look at this. the three of us back together again.
how are you, carl ?
johnny, i'm sorry it had to be your unit on planet p. that mission had a very low survival probability...
bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? we thought there might be a brain on p.
you don't approve. well, too bad. we're in this for the species, boys and girls. it's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
didn't they tell you, colonel ? that's what cap troopres are good for.
hope you're ready for more. we're going back to p to capture that brain.
the roughnecks are always ready, sir.
i hear they need a new lieutenant... want the job ?
i'll take it... until i get killed or you find someone better.
take care, wilya johnny ?
see you on the bounce !
where's lieutenant barcalow ?
he requested a combat assignment. there's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. i had no choice but to let him go... he said you'd understand.
we got reinforced. most of'em just got outa boot...
we're the old men, ace.
we'll take this high ground. lookouts there and therte and up there. if the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
got it. fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
down there on the flats, eh ? listen up, roughnecks ! our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet...
you're standing on my h.q., lieutenant !
this is a fleet-driven operation, son, and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. you can have everything else, eh ?
you heard the sky marshall... move it all down -
rodger young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  i'll take the first group.
saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
this is rodger young, we're going down... repeat, this is rodger young, we're going down...!
ibanez...let's go !
leave me, lieutenant ! that's an order !
no way, ma'am !
what's your problem now, lieutenant ?
the rodger young just burned up...
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa !
we've gotta go get her !
we're outa here. lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. this real estate's about to go buggy.
hey, just calm down, i'm giving the orders here-
what do you think you're doing ?
i'm gonna save carmen.
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. they hang you for that, rico.
yeah, that's right.
let's go.
move out.
mr. barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... ace, tell aardvark we're on our way...
yes, sir !
can you walk ?
not a problem.
let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
i thought i was dead. lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
it wasn't luck. rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
is it true ?
which way ?
up. we gotta be near a company by now.
how bad are you, pal ?
been better, buddy.
alright, we're gonna carry you...
nah, i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... gimmee the nuke.
don't be a hero...
this is my farm. now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
zander, what are you doing ?
just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
zander, no...!
you always told me you couldn't do human...
i can't... but like i told you, it's a number's game. the federation needs all the pilots it can get...
saddle up, roughnecks !
you heard the lieutenant ! on the bounce, troopers !
