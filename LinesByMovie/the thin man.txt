i'm sorry...  but...
two weeks work gone for nothing.
i just wanted to tell you...
i don't care what you wanted to tell me.  you're through!  get your things and get out!
how are you?
another young man.
it's the same one.
it's been the same one for three months.
forgive me.  how are you?
take a good look at him, dad.  now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
well!
that is, if it's all right with you.
and if it isn't?
he'll still be your son-in-law!
you see how much we have to say.
dad, this is what i really wanted to ask you....
mind if i look around?
help yourself.  oh, tom, show this gentleman...
where are you going?
home!
home?
i'm fired.
who fired you?
you did.
mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
yes, she would.
i hate all that fuss.  but i'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
what would your mother say to that?
this is my wedding.
wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
he can stay home.  please, dad, won't you?
if you think it'll be all right.
wait a minute.  when is it going to be? i'm leaving town tonight.
where are you going?
it's a secret.  i can't even tell you, my dear.  i've got an important idea to work on.
a new invention?
yes.  and i don't want anybody to steal it from me.
we were planning to be married right after christmas.
oh, i'll be back before christmas.
it's a promise?
that's one thing i won't forget.  where's macaulay?  i ought to be starting.
how's your brother?
he's all right.
i'd like to see him.  why don't you bring him down?
you know how it is, dad.  he's sort of under mother's thumb.
i know -- i know --
you're not missing much.  he's cuckoo.
like all the rest of us.  has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
and he still wants to marry me!
he's a brave man.
i didn't know you invented that smelting process.
look -- those are the first metals that came through.
poor dad, does that still bother you?
only in bad weather.
but it isn't bad weather now.
better get home before it is.
goodbye, darling.  don't you dare forget...  december 30th.
goodbye, my boy.  take care of dorothy.  show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
all settled?  grand!  why did your mother ever divorce him?  he's swell.
wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
oh.  i'll do my own typing!
how are you?  here.  get under this.
thanks...  we're taking your cab.
is your father still in there?
he's waiting for you.
did he tell you where he was going?
he wouldn't say.
tch-tch-tch --  well, goodbye, miss wynant.  you wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
did you get my money?
i do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
i'm not telling anyone.
but suppose some business comes up...
that's just why i'm going.
one hundred...  two hundred... three...
never mind.
i wish you'd count them.  there's a thousand dollars there.
i trust you.
isn't there anything else i can do for you? have you bought your ticket?
no.
well, let me do that for you.
you might do that.  get me a ticket for...  no, you don't!
thanks, and goodbye.
what'll i do if something comes up?
settle it yourself.  what have i got a lawyer for?
is julia going with you?
no.
but what if you need more money?
i left instructions with julia. she'll get it from you.  goodbye.
well, congratulations.
i'm going to give her a wedding present.  thought i'd better do it now, before i forget it.  i can drop them on my way to...  that's funny....  where are those bonds?
bonds, sir?
i know i left them there.
maybe miss wolf has them.
maybe she has.
you're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  it's at the grand central.
oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
we're just having a little drink.
so i see.
who's that man?
he's not anybody.  just a fellow i used to know.
i thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
this is the first time i've seen him in years.  i didn't want him to think i was high-hatting him.
i don't like him.
don't worry.  you won't see him again.  what happened? did you change your mind about going?
no.  i just came back for a second. i wanted to get those bonds.
what bonds?
the government bonds.  the ones you took from the office safe.
oh yes.  why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
i'd never tell you to sell those. i bought them for my daughter.
don't you remember....
now see here, julia.  you're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  you've been taking a little here and there for some time, and i haven't said anything about it.  but this is fifty thousand dollars!
do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
no one else had the combination of that safe.  you took them.  what did you do with them?
what if i did take them? i'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
that's my business.
supporting that gang of loafers! there's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  a wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  they wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  and i've given my whole life for you.  if you kicked off tomorrow, where'd i be? out in the gutter!  sure i took those bonds.  who has a better right -- ?
i want that money right now, or i'll hand you over to the police.
go ahead!
they'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
that's a fine thing to throw up to me after all i've been to you....
hello ....  give me ....  well ....  ?
i'll give it back to you ....  all i've got ....twenty-five thousand...
you're going to return every cent of it!
i can't! i haven't got it!
what did you do with the rest?
i never had it.
then someone was in with you.  who was it? -- who was it?  i'll answer that --  hello ...  hello ...
cheer up, darling.
i'm sorry.
what's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
it's all right.
darling, your father's all right. he'll turn up in time.
but tonight is christmas eve!
he's just forgotten.  you know he forgets everything.
he's never forgotten a promise to me.  i'm worried about him.  i know something's happened to him.
what could happen to him, darling? you mustn't worry....  what is it?
just a minute...
another martini --
hello, there!
you know, we know each other.
of course we do! we've been friends for years.
aren't you nick charles?
yes.
you don't remember me.....  i'm dorothy wynant.
not that scrawny little....?
yes.
how did you ever remember me?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  you used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  were they true?
probably not.
andy...  this is nick charles.  he worked on a case for father.
yes.  some nut who wanted to kill him.  how is your father?
that's what i was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
disappeared!
now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
i can't find him.  i've tried everything.  i thought you might know.
i don't know anything -- i've been in california for four years. what about his lawyer? used to be a guy named mac-- something.
macaulay.
that's it...  herbert macaulay.
tried him once -
why don't you try him again?
she's got me worrying, too.
don't start worrying about him. he's a good guy, but screwy.
why did that man want to kill him?
said he stole his invention.
do you suppose.....  ?
what?
nothing.
you better take a drink.
so it's you he was after!
hello, baby.
he's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
i had him out this morning.
i thought so.  he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
oh, this is andy --
you might have mentioned me first.
he's well-trained.  he'll behave himself.
as long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  what i've gone through --
any luck?
he's just around the corner.
your father?
no.  the lawyer -- i'm going to see him.
how do you do?  i'm sorry we have to rush.
we're at the normandie for a couple of weeks.  why don't you drop around?
thanks.  we will.  goodbye.
pretty girl.
if you like 'em like that.
you got types?
only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
who is she?
i was hoping i wouldn't have to tell you.  dorothy is really my daughter.  you see, it was spring in venice, and i was so young.  i didn't know what i was doing.  we were all like that on my father's side.
by the way, how is your father's side?
much better, thanks.
how many drinks have you had?
six martinis.
six martinis.  you're not going to have anything on me.
what hit me?
that last martini.
i can't lie here.  i've got to get up and trim that darned christmas tree.
take it easy.
who's that?
santa claus.
how are you?
hello, macaulay.  come in.
dorothy told me you were here.  i was going to telephone but....
that's all right.  what are you drinking?
nothing, thank you.  nothing.  i wanted to see you...  what's mimi up to, charles?
mimi?  ...  oh, dorothy's mother.  does she have to be up to something?
she usually is.  trying one way or another to get money out of wynant. i wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
i haven't been a detective for four years.
you don't say --
my wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  and i'm looking after them.
i see.  i see.
what's all the fuss about? is he in hiding?
you know as much about it as i do. i haven't seen him in three months.
no word at all?
he sends word through julia wolf when he wants money...  i give it to her and she gives it to him.
is there a mr. macaulay in the house?  oh, it's you.
yes?
my wife.
how do you do?  what did you say?....  he is?.... where is he?  very well.  he's back in town....  wynant.  thank heaven.  he's waiting for me now.  forgive me, mrs. charles...  but i've been so upset.  it's no joke working for a man like that.  i must be off.  goodbye....  goodbye,
s'long.
how are you?....  oh, i'm mrs. jorgensen now....  no, she isn't here.  is it about her father?  well, can i take the message?
give it to me.
oh, here she is.
i just wanted to relieve your mind. your father's alive and all right.
oh, thank heaven.
what is it? has he found him?
do you know where he's living?  oh....  well, at least i'm glad he's all right.  thank you for calling. goodbye.
what is it?
nothing.
that isn't true.  it was about your father.  where is he?
he's all right.  isn't that enough?
no.
you just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  he made a big settlement on you.
that's gone long ago.  i've got to see him.  where is he?
i won't have you hounding him any more for money.
what is it, gilbert? tell mother! what did he say?
he said that father's in town. he's been seeing julia right along.
that woman!
she could tell you where father is.
mother ....  you couldn't do that. you couldn't go to her.
i didn't say i would.  but we've got to have money.
did it ever occur to you that chris might work?
shush!
don't mind what she says, chris.
how can i help but mind? i'm constantly humiliated...  just because i haven't money.
i'll get some.
you've said that for weeks.
i know.
why don't you go to see julia? she handles his money.
chris!
all right.  all right.
i couldn't go near that woman.
i said all right!
what are you going to do?
just what i said i'd do.
you wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
wouldn't i.  just watch me.
chris -- chris -- !
when was the last time you gave her money for wynant?
yesterday.  i gave her a thousand dollars.
seen any signs of it, bill?
i said he hadn't written me.
oh, then you did hear from him?
well....
well, what?
he telephoned me today.
he did!
i wasn't in.  my secretary took the message.  he left word for me to meet him at the plaza.
when was that?
about three.
did you go?
yes.  but he didn't show up.
i know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  you can't think he had anything to do with it, mr. guild.  he wasn't the kind of man that....
do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
i didn't know they had a fight.
well, thanks.  we'll call you when we need you again.
and there she was lying dead.  the police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before i got there.
i thought you said you weren't going there.
why, you said...
never mind.
did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
not a thing.
was there much blood?
don't.  it's horrible.
nonsense! she got at she deserved.
did you kill her?
gilbert!
why not? you had a perfectly good motive.
i hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
well, i've got my alibi.  i was at the public library.  where were you?
children, will you go into the next room? i want to talk to chris alone.
there are a few things we want to check up on.
i see.
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
why yes.
did you see anything in miss wolfe's hand?
no.
are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
i don't think so.  of course i was terribly upset...  i hardly knew what i was doing.
the medical examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  he says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
that's all right.  well, we'll be going.
goodbye.
goodbye.
you took that money from julia's hand.
i didn't.
then what are you hiding?
it's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
you hand that over to the police.
i'll do nothing of the sort.
all right, then.  i'll tell them.
i don't think you will.  it's your father's.
i don't believe it! you're lying!
there!
oh!
now do you believe me!
nick charles here?
yes.  nick!
you his wife?
yes.
he's a good guy.  he sent me up the river once.  hey, nick!
was he a good detective?
i wouldn't know.  that time he caught me was a accident.  i led with my right.
sorry.  i don't know anything about it.
come on, gimme a break.
i never tried to kid you reporters -- i'm telling you the truth.
come on -- relax --  give them a drink.
we need ice.
i'd better order some food.  that sounds like an interesting case.  wouldn't you like to take it?
i haven't the time.  i'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money i married you for.
room service, please -
sounds like a good case.  girl mysteriously murdered.  no one knows who did it.  they haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
i wonder if they've --  i don't want to hear anything about it.
isn't that my drink?
what are you drinking?
rye.
come on in.
i've got to see you alone!
you heard about julia wolf?
yes.
there.
what are you trying to tell me? that you did it?
yes.  i hated her for coming between my mother and father.  she kept me from seeing my father.  i went down there to ask her where he was.  she wouldn't tell me, and i shot her.
where did you hit her?
why... in the heart.
pretty good shot you are. what did she do?
she fell down.
did she make any sound?  didn't scream?
i don't know.
which way did she fall?
she... she fell over backwards.
oh, yeah?  people fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  i knew you were lying.
where did you get this gun?
i bought it in a pawn shop.
don't lie to me.
that's the truth.
where did you get that?
she brought it in.  trying to make me believe she did it.
what are you going to do with it?
nothing, 'til i find out if it's the gun julia wolf was killed with.  keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. they might believe her.
oh, nick... nick!
hello, mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
clyde wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. no wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
what do you think?
oh, i know he didn't, but i wish i could find him...  i have something very important to tell him. macaulay won't help at all.  he thinks i just want money.
well, don't you?
you're always teasing.
nick, you will help me find clyde -- won't you?
now, mimi, there are a thousand detectives in new york.  hire one of them.
but he knows you.  all you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that mimi says everything is all right... but that i've got to see him.
i tell you again, i don't want any part of it.  now you take dorothy home and...
dorothy!  is she here?
yes...
she didn't tell me a thing.
too bad you didn't bring your whip.
where's gilbert?
gilbert!  is he here too?  we might as well be living in the lobby.
there's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with julia wolf that the police have overlooked.  and i think it explains everything.  you see, my father was a sexogenarian.
he was?
yes.  he admitted it.
sexogerarian, eh?  yes.  yes.  but i can't put that in the paper.
why not?
you know how they are... sex...
then just say he was sixty years old.
is that what it means?
of course.
nick!  nick!  are you asleep?
yes.
good. i want to talk to you.
that's jolly.
don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
can't you get to sleep?
no.
maybe a drink would help you.
no thanks.
maybe it would if i took it.
everybody says you were a grand detective.
they were kidding you.
i'd like to see you work.
tomorrow i'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
that poor girl is in a tough spot.
there's nothing i can do to help her.
she thinks you can. it wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
darling, my guess is that wynant killed julia and dorothy knows it. and the police'll catch him without my help.
i think i would like that drink.  i'll give you your christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
at breakfast.
but it's christmas now.
breakfast.
what are you going to give me?  i hope i don't like it.
you'll have to keep them anyway. the man at the aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
nick!  nick!  there's someone to she you,
that's great.  i was afraid i'd have to go to sleep.
i gotta talk to you.  i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight. get me?
do you mind putting that gun away? my wife doesn't care, but i'm in a delicate condition.
you idiot!  asta! stop that!  get down!  now, stay there.
all right... shoot!  i mean... what's on your mind?
i've never heard about you.
i didn't knock julia off.
all right - you didn't.
i haven't seen her in three months. we were all washed up.
why tell me?
i wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  she was always on the up and up with me.  but that dirty little nunheim -- he got sore cause i clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
that's all swell.  only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. i've got nothing to do with it.
listen.  "studsy" burke told me you used to be o.k. that's why i'm here. do  they....
how is studsy?  i didn't know he was out of stir.
he's all right. he'd like to see you. but listen...  what's the law doing to me?  do they think i did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
i'd tell you if i knew. but i'm not in this.  ask the police.
that'd be very smart.  that'd be the smartest thing i ever did. me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  the boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  they'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. now i come to you on the level. studsy says you're on the level. be on the level.
i am on the level. if i knew anything i'd....
what's that?
this is your party.
it's all right.  it just grazed me.
someone get a doctor.
there's one coming.
well, quick -- get into bed.  are you all right?
sure -- i don't even feel it.
i'll get some towels.
i'll be all right. don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
want a drink?
yeah.
how'd you people happen to pop in?
we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  and pretty lucky for you.
yes.  i might not have been shot.
we were looking for this bird.
i never saw him before.
what's he want of you?
wanted to tell me he didn't kill julia wolf.
what's that to you?
nothing.
what'd he think it was to you?
ask him.  i don't know.
i'm asking you.
keep on asking.
not without a warrant.
so you say -  go on, bob.
have you got a pistol permit?
no.
ever heard of the sullivan act?
this gun yours?
no.
who's is it?
i'll have to try to remember.
okay.  there's plenty of time. i guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. we'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  come on.
i wish that doctor'd come.  how do you feel?
he'll be here.  give him time to get his trousers on.  where's asta?  asta!  asta!
you're a fine watch dog.
he's got more sense than you have. thank heaven you're not on this case.
on it!  i'm in it ... they think i did it!
well, didn't you?
i never saw that before.
no.  it's a christmas present.
who gave it to you?
you did.
you must admit i have good taste.
finished with these?
yes.  i know all they know about the murder. and i'm a great hero. the tribune said i was shot twice.
i read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
that's not true.  he never came near my tabloids.  that's one thing i always protect... my tabloids.
hello... send him up.
who's that?
macaulay.
aren't you hot in that?
i'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  the kirbys.
is that another christmas present?
yes.
did i give it to you?
yes.
nick, listen.  from clyde wynant!  "will you take charge of investigation on julia wolf murder. communicate with herbert macaulay".
let's see.  where's it from?
philadelphia.  then he didn't do it, did he, nick?
i don't know.
he wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
your guess is as good as mine.
oh take it!  please take it!
oh, hello.  come on in.
good morning. i'm afraid this isn't a very "merry christmas" for you.
oh, he's sitting up.
good.
how are you?
i hate to bother you when you're laid up.
that's all right.
asta - don't bother mr. macaulay.
that's all right.
oh, it's a fire hydrant.
yes.  it's asta's christmas present.
i got word from wynant this morning...
so did we.  i mean, sherlock here.
what are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
slim.
oh, please, nick.
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you?
it might.
he gave me a code message to insert in the times, in case i wanted to get in touch with him.
it wouldn't hurt to put it in.
i've done that already. he should appear, you know.  it doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
hello.... oh, just a minute.  police department?
hello....  where?  in allentown.  yes... when is the next train? right - i'll get that.  wynant's tried to commit suicide. they want me to come down and identify him.  i guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  that looks like an admission of guilt.  and i had such hopes.  i thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  i thought that mimi.... the way she acted... i was sure that....  oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  i'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
well, that's that.  stay there, nick!
it's not going to hurt me to get up.
sit down!
you talk as if i were asta.
all right, hard guy.  get up and bleed on the rugs.
what's the trouble, asta?  your balloon busted?  so's mine.
what's the matter with you?
the mystery's all gone. and i wanted you to find out who did it.
maybe i will.
but wynant --- ?
i don't believe he did it.
why don't you?
no reason.  just a hunch.  but i'm going to find out.  i'm tired of being pushed around.
so am i.
come on, watson, we're going places.
good morning --
good morning, lieutenant -  sorry.
you oughtn't to play this trick on me.  running out when i was giving you time to rest up before i asked you those questions.
you mean about that gun?
that ain't a gun any more.  the firing pin's busted - the -  don't waste time talking about that.
man to man, mr. charles, are you working on this case?
man to man, i'm not.
but he's interested!
i don't mind telling you i'd rather have you working with us than against us.
so would i.
it's a bargain then.  anything you want to know?
what about the suicide?
oh, that's a phoney.  the men didn't even have to go down.
i thought it might be.  from now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is wynant.
do you think that wynant did it?
looks like he planned, something. he shut up his apartment and his shop.
you've been there?
yeah. couldn't find a thing. this is the way we figure it.  wynant goes to julia's apartment. he finds morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  they have a fight. but he figures he don't want to do anything then.... morelli might squeal.  so he goes away. he don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him, so that julia will think it's all blown over. then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
no proof?
nothing yet to cinch it.
fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
what do you mean?
for one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
who's your candidate?
i haven't got that far yet.  but i don't think that everything points to wynant.  what about the alibis?
they're all o.k.  mrs. jorgensen, the boy, dorothy, macaulay... even morelli... we had to let him go.
what about jorgensen?
i'll check on that.  i'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
what about this nunheim?
oh, he's all right.  we know all about him.  he does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
did you know he was hanging around julia?
no.
he's holding out on you.
let's go and see.  taxi!
this may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
catch me letting you go alone!
have a shot?
what's the idea of telling me you just knew the wolfe girl by sight?
that's all i did, lieutenant. that's the god's truth.  maybe i said hello to her or how are you or something like that when i saw her, but that's all i knew her. that's the truth.  all right.  put your mouth in and i'll pop a tooth out of it.
she drives me nuts.  she's been ragging me all day.
maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
that's a lie, lieutenant...  anybody that says that is a liar.
want to take a poke at him?
i didn't mean you, mister.
you'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
you don't think i had anything to do with it?
where were you?
where were you?
marian!  marian! don't go! i'll behave!  i'll do anything!  don't go, marian!
let me go!  let me bring her back. i can't get along without her. i'll bring her right back and i'll tell you anything you want to know. let me go!
sit down!  we didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a may pole.  where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
i can't remember offhand, lieutenant.  maybe i was over at charlie's shooting pool. maybe i was here.  she'd remember.
how'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
just give me a minute....  i'll remember. i'm not stalling, lieutenant.  you know i always come clean with you.  gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon i was.... wait, i'll show you...!
well, what'd you think?
i think we're on the right track.
who're you calling?
i'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. i want to see where he goes.
trail him!  trail who?
nunheim!
chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- i don't see that it's important --
you should have told them he'd disappeared.
but he has nothing to do with it!
that's not for you to decide. everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  the police will want his description.  is this a picture of him?
i tell you -- he didn't do it.
they'll want more than your word for that.
all right, then -- i'll tell them who did do it!
mother!
and i'll give then proof!
oh, andy.
don't cry.
i can't help it.  you don't know.....
darling, you can't go through any more of this.  now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
i can't.
you've got to get your mind off this.
you're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
go!
and don't ever try to see me again.
what are you talking about?
please!  you can't get mixed up in this.
do you think i care
you don't understand.  you don't know what's going to happen.
i only know i want to marry you... right now, and --
i can't marry you!  i can't ever marry you!
dorothy!
how would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  it'd be fun, wouldn't it?  maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. that's what father should have done.  he should have killed me and gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
you're talking like a crazy person,
why not? i am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
dorothy.... listen to me. i love you.  don't you understand that? i love you.
go away!
get anything?
she's ready to talk.  it won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
i guess that cinches it, eh, mr. charles?  he killed them both - julia wolf and nunheim.
fifty will still get you a hundred.
this is enough for me.
i wish they'd stop that.  it makes me fidgety. do you think they'll find him, nick?  he must be in new york....  where do you think you're going?
i'm going to take asta for a walk.
he's just been for a walk.
we're going sightseeing -- aren't we, asta?
what's that?  what are you up to?  nickie - what is this?
looks like a hold-up!
what are you going to do?
i've got hunch.  i'm going down to look at wynant's shop, i want to find out why it's closed.
why shouldn't be close it? he went away.
he went away lots of times when i knew him - but he never closed his shop. i've got a hunch something is up.
you mean, he might be hiding there?
i don't know...  this thing has got my goat. i've got to find out.
nick - i won't have you going down there.
say you're the one who got me in this!
i know but this is different. he's a crazy man. he might kill you.
i'll be all right.  i've got asta to protect me.
go on - go on - see if i care. but it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow.
you wouldn't be a widow long.
you bet i wouldn't.
not with all your money!
you dog!
goodbye, darling.
nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
sure i will.
don't say it that way. say it as if you meant it.
why, i believe the little woman cares.
i don't care - i'm just used to you, that's all --  if you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
come on out, now.  he won't hurt you.  back to your old tricks, eh, tanner?
no, mr. charles.
how did you get in here?
i had a key. i worked here... till they closed the shop.
you worked here?
yes, sir.  julia wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
well, that's a hot one.  you a bookkeeper!  when were you ever a bookkeeper?
that time you sent me up last ... i learned book-keeping at sing sing.  i figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
honest, mr, charles.  i never touched that safe.  them bonds that were missing... julia took them.
trying to put it off on her?
mr. charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. listen, mr. charles --  i did do a little chiseling.  i come to bring it back and fix up the books.  i didn't want him to find out and come after me -
you can save that and tell it to the police.  they'll be here in a minute.
police!
just rolled them up and threw them in.
lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
extraordinarily lucky.
"d.w.r."  that case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill wynant... what what was his name?
rosebreen.
could this be him?
i never saw him.  i don't think anyone saw him.
he said wynant tried to steal an invention.
yes.  but we figured it was just blackmail...
just the same, wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  how long should you say this body'd been here, doc?
you can take that out to the car.
going to run him through the fluoroscope?
yes.
do you mind if i come down and see it?
not at all.
i'm very interested in that body.
what're you doing here?
i'll take care of him.
shrapnel!
must have been in the war.  that might account for the cane and his limp.
yes... yes.
have the police got any idea where wynant is?
no.
what about this rosebreen?
sorry.  don't know a thing.
what's your next step, nick?
right back to california.  we've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
we'll see you before you go.
back to california
my soul, woman.  i give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
i want you to stay and find wynant.
i did find him!
what do you mean?
he was down in the shop.
nick!
it was his body that was buried there.
nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
that's a fact.
wynant's body?
yup.  don't you want something to eat?
but they all said it was rosebreen's.
that's what they think... guild and all of them.  they take it for granted that it's just another of wynant's victims.  guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for wynant. that's all that troubles him.
what makes you so sure it's wynant's body?
several things.  hello, fred.  we're hungry again. yeah, and lots of onions.  oh, and coffee.
nick, you'll drive me crazy.  what things?
huh?
what things made you so sure?
oh.  well, the clothes for instance. they were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  the person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
well, don't they?
sure.
you don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  it often bothered him.  so i looked for it and i found it.  gimme.
how long has he been dead?
couple of months anyway.
then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
smart gal.
wynant dead?  does dorothy know?
no.  nobody but you.
i'm going to tell her.
hey... hey.  don't do that.
but the poor kid's going crazy. she'd rather know her father was dead than that...
i can't help it. i can't tell a soul.  i didn't even tell guild.
why not?
i want to lie low till i get the whole dope.  i don't want to go off half-cocked.
what are you going to do?
i'm going to get the real murderer. i've got an idea.  want to see me take him?
yes!
got a nice evening dress?
now nick, what's that got to do with it?
got a nice evening dress?
i've got a lulu -- why?
i'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
the suspects!  they won't come.
oh, they'll come.  i'll have guild issue the invitations.
who do you think did it?
mimi...
mimi!
mimi, jorgensen, morelli, tanner.....
hello, dorothy.
hello, nick!  and a party - celebrating father's third murder -
this is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
you're high enough.
why not?
i think we may as well sit down.
i guess all the suspects are here.
mr. guild means guests!  oh, there are two more to come.
they'll be here.  don't worry.  my men are picking them up.
you're a great help to a hostess. i wish i always had you for my dinner parties.
you give such charming parties, mr. charles.
thank you, mrs. charles.
i can't wait any longer.  tell me, do you think one of them did it?
yes.
i wish you'd tell me who.
i wish you'd tell me.
this is all very pleasant but why are here?
i've got some very important news - i've seen wynant.
you did!
that's nothing.  i saw him myself.
you did... where?
last night.  he came to see me at my apartment.
oh, did he?  what did he say?
he didn't say very much.  wanted to know how i was and how the children were.
what kind of clothes was he wearing?
a brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
tell 'em.
i saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
what are you talking about, gilbert? you weren't there!
know.  but i saw him -
serve the nuts - i mean, serve the guests the nuts.
i'm afraid you're lying, mimi. you see, i really did see wynant last night.
are you kidding?
no.
why didn't you tell me? .... why didn't you hold him?
because i found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
he didn't do it -- nick!
what do you mean?
that's ridiculous.
let him have his say out.
morelli -  you knew julia.  was she gypping wynant?
she don't say she is, but i figure she is -
why do you say that?
once i wanted five grand --  cash -
thank you.  now i'll tell you why i know wynant didn't commit those murders -  three months ago - the night that he caught you in julia's apartment, he found out that julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  he went to find the man. that man was.... tanner, don't you...?
i'm sorry.  tanner, don't you want some wine?
no... no.
you're going to drive me crazy!
let's see... where was i?  oh, yes.  he went to find the man. that man was desperate!  he knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. he killed wynant.  it's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, dorothy.
dead?
he's been dead for three months.
darling, don't cry.  please.  i know it's terrible.  but isn't it really better this way?
oh, andy, andy!
because i don't believe that clyde's dead!  why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
so i did.  i saw him lying buried in his shop.
you mean that body-----?
--was wynant's.
perfectly absurd.
and the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  you may serve the fish.
what am i?  the fall guy?
i hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  nice food, isn't it?
if that knife is missing, i'll look for it in your back.
after our hero had killed wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  he realized that he and julia could still collect money.  wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay, signing wynant's name, so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia.  he even telephoned macaulay --  do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
but it must have been wynant.  i should have known if it weren't his voice.
oh he as clever about that.  he called when you were out.  that same afternoon, julia telephoned to him. she said that you were coming, mimi, to ask about wynant. he got terrified. he was afraid that julia would break down and tell... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant's watch chain in her hand.
is that true?
i don't know.
why are you saying it?
it's the only way it makes sense.
i hope you're well.
his plan was still working beautifully. wynant was established as being in town.  the watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. the only hitch was a man named nunheim who had found out something.  our hero paid nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
shut up.
you see, he'd been very clever. everybody, even our astute friend guild, thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. but our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  the telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant. so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case.  mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen wynant?
nobody told me.  i did see him!
what did he pay you, mimi, to stick to that story?
it isn't a story - it's true.  i did see wynant.  he's not dead.
you're lying, mimi.  but then, you'd do anything for money.  you're getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
i'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
macaulay, you drew up wynant's will.  mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
i have no right to answer that.
what about it, tanner.  isn't that the truth?
that's what mr. wynant said to me. if she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
you shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, mimi.  mrs. jorgensen -  were you ever divorced from chris jorgensen?
