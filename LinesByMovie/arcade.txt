he thinks i'm "sublimating".
what the hell does that mean?
it means she's screwed up.
fucked up.  that's what they said i was.
listen to me, alex.  these counselor's don't know anything.  they're full of shit. if you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
i know.
so tell me you're okay, then.
i'm okay.
good.   cause i'd freak if you weren't.
cool.
can you say anything but "cool"?
of course i can.  i can say all sorts of things...
come on.  we'll hit dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
and then keep on driving?
sure.  never come back.  disappear forever.
we're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  we think it's going to be a big seller.  but you're the people that make it happen.  you're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  it's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
so what's so different about arcade? you guys've been talking about it for months.
a man after my own heart.  straight to the point.  what's different about arcade is the way it reacts.  it responds like a human does.  it learns.  it adapts. each time you play, it changes its strategy.
that's impossible.
is it?  why don't you see for your self?
"escape"?
in case things get too intense.  it automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  things can get pretty wild...
so what's the scenario?  am i saving a princess?  fighting zombies?
it changes.  there are eleven levels. each one is a different layer of the arcade universe.  the concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... arcade's brain.
so how do i start?
the game will guide you.
go for it.
hold my keys, then.
so what do you think?
sign me up.
has anyone seen greg?
he's probably outside.  you know how he is. gets bored...
so where is he?
guess he took off...  you have his keys, right?
hmmm.  he said you were going to have dinner?
yeah...
so take his car home.  wait.  i'm sure he's up to something...
but he was playing the game.  i mean, you saw him...
hello?
hey, kid.
nick...
have you played the game yet?  it's incredible!  i was just...
listen to me!  greg never came home. i think the game has something to do with it.
what the hell are you talking about?
i have to talk to you.
we are talking...
no, in person.  now.
it's twelve-thirty!
i'm coming over.
alex, you don't know how long i've waited for this.
funny.
what do you mean by "weird"?
greg never came home.  a few hours is one thing, nick, but this is different. something's happened to him.
can you turn off the game?
i'm in the middle of it...
turn if off!
happy?
no.  look, i know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  i think the game's alive somehow.
no, wait.  just listen.  i hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  as soon as i turned it on, nick.  it said my name.  how could it know?  and then, i asked it where greg was, and it said, "in here".
alex, i think you're freaking out. greg's gone, i'll give you that.  and maybe he's in trouble.  but it's not arcade that's doing it...
it is.
how?!  it's a machine, alex. machine's don't think.  they're not alive.  it's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
so how did it know my name, then?
you imagined it.
see, men always do this.  "quiet down, honey.  chill out.  take a valium". i'm not a fucking idiot, nick!  i did not imagine it!!!
quiet.  i do have parents, you know.
it turned itself back on, nick.
no it didn't.  it's just a faulty relay or something.  it happens.
sorry.  maybe i need the valium.
call the others.  laurie, benz...
something's happened to them.
it's the middle of the night.  they're asleep.  phone didn't wake them.
all of them?
because i didn't know where else to go.
it's two o'clock in the morning.  go home. go to sleep.  we'll figure something out in the morning.
it's not this weird.  it'll make sense. everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
sure.
sick?
everybody's sick, huh?  it's fifteen after.  we always meet here, you know that.
what's her problem?
did you play arcade last night?
actually, no.  i was just telling nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
we have to find out what's happened to them. i think they're gone...
no way.
if they're sick, great.  but let's make sure.  come on, nick.
okay.  we'll see what's up.  but if things are cool, i don't want to hear anything more about this.  life's too short, know what i mean?
well?
she thought benz was at school.
where to now?
laurie's.
this is like a movie or something.  i mean, am i paranoid or what?
it doesn't necessarily mean she's...
let's go around back.
change the channel!
what?!
then leave her.
we can't...
we'll call 911.  look around alex.  we broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
where do we go?
my house.  i want to try something.
that's what i thought.
what?
it's not just the cable system.  it's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  it's everywhere.
nick, what is it.
maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  it's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  it's self-replicating...it mimics life.
like the fractals?
it's growing.  getting stronger. maybe it's only localized now...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
right.  and then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
anywhere.  we have to stop it from getting out.
it's already out.
the police, then...
give me a break, alex.  what are we going to tell them?  excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  i'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
then where do we go?!
i don't know.
slip-stream.
what?
they made arcade.  it's still a game, right?  it thinks like a game.  maybe it still has to play by the rules. someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
you mean we learn the rules...
and beat it at it's own game.
you realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
i was afraid you'd say that.
virgin sacrifices?
drives 'em crazy every time.
nick, alex, how are we today?
how'd you know it was us?
security camera.  pulled your files before i came down. be careful what you say, kids ... i know where you live.
now what seems to be the problem?
it's the game, arcade.
you don't like it?
if this is a joke, i'm not laughing.
neither are we.  something's wrong with the game, mr. difford.
why don't we take this into my office.
talk to me.
there's something wrong with arcade. the game's alive somehow...
what alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
no i'm not...
we're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  i mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
this is one of our newest projects. we're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
the air-force is working on the same thing.
does that thing work?
getting there.  it's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  but what can i do for you?
we're having some problems with arcade...
yeah, who isn't.
what do you mean?
it's a tough game.  hard to pin that bastard down.  keeps on changing the rules.
we vere thinking there might be tricks. you know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
sure.  every game's got 'em.  i'll start with the schematics.  i can print these up if you want.
you've got your ten levels, right? here they are...  each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  first one's the blood red sky, then you've got the blue desert, tower of ghosts, kingdom of the blind...  on each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  if you're too late, the screamer comes.
how do you stop the screamer?
you can't.  he gets you and you're dead. it's like time catching up with you, you know?  like fate.  each level you get progressively less time to complete.  first half of the game takes place in the wild lands.  then you reach level 6, and that's the sea of darkness.  there's a two-headed boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  if you don't...
what's the riddle?
if i tell you, then it's no fun.
just tell me the fucking riddle.
well...it involves a paradox.  you have to trick the boatman.  now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  you can build that back up by catching fireflies...the little glowing guys...
the next half of the game takes place in arcade's brain, the city of truth. it's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. screamer comes faster here.  on level four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  gotta time it right though.
what's the question mark?
level ten.  that's where you've got to unlock arcade's heart using the keys you've found.
how do you do that?
good question.  see, that's where the fun comes in.  arcade changes it every time. he's a machine without a soul. once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
but how can it change every time?
it's the game's logic core.  we actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  i mean, there's a personality in there. that's what makes it so incredible.
how the hell did you do that?
well, we're veering into classified info here, but i'll tell you that it involved a donor.  he was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
dead?
well, brain-dead anyway.  coma patient. it's really not all that important.
maybe he's not dead.
he?
the donor.  maybe he's alive inside the game.
and maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
could you play arcade with that?
well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
thanks, albert.  think you could print up those schematics?
sure.
go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. and make it quick, okay?
what are you going to do?
get that helmet.  if we're going to play arcade, i want every advantage possible.
jesus christ!
i can't believe you made it!
you got the schematics?
everything.
i've been thinking about that.  arcade's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  you know, like his point of origin?
dante's inferno.
yeah.  the inferno.
alex...
you didn't hear me?
what are you looking for?
a way to hook this helmet into the game. i'm sure there are interfaces...
i don't understand.  it wants us to play the game.  it's been taunting us ...
put in a quarter.
it can turn itself on, alex!  it doesn't need a quarter.
yes it does.  don't you see?  we have to play by the rules.  that's what it wants.
you're not coming, alex.
yes i am...
i know how to do this!  i'm good at these games.  you never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
and what if something happens to you? am i suppose to go in after you alone?!
no.  if you're smart, you run like hell.
you don't get it, do you?
what?
i don't want anything to happen to you.  i care about you.
i already have a boyfriend, nick.
i know.  it sucks.
you feel it?  it's different this time.
we're actually inside, aren't we?
okay.  give us a kiss?
one.  in case...
don't even say it.
thanks.  always wanted to do that.
yeah, well i figure these are unusual circumstances.
that's what i was hoping you'd say.
i'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  you watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
got it.
which way do you think level two is?
you've got the schematics, check.
okay.  it's west.
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  once we get all the keys, we can unlock arcade's heart. and then...
the clock's already ticking.
right, then...
and we've still got time left.  this was a piece of cake.
yeah, that's what worries me.
hey, my strength's low.  look out for fireflies.
there...
shit...
check your read-out.
our time's up.
what?!  there's nothing here!
look around...
what the fuck is that?!
screamer.
we can't reach that!
we don't have a choice!
so that's what we almost died for?
one of them, anyway...  did you see it?  the screamer?
i don't want to talk about it.
christ...no time...
there never is.
we can take the dunes down like a ski slope. pretend you're on a snowboard.
never been on a snowboard.
one of these cities, is the place you seek. the teller of truths will take you there. but the city of lies, is dark and bleak. and death is certain if you enter, beware.
i am the liar.  where should i take you?
i am the truth teller.  where should i take you?
what did he do to you?
is that your question?
wait!  no!  that's not it!
think!  i want to go to the city of truth, and the truth teller is from there...but which one is which?  the liar...think!
you have no time.  what is your question?
i'm thinking!
you have no time.
liar.  did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
i came from the city on the left.
but you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  that means the city on the left must be the city of truth.
how did you get here?  did you play the game?!
yes...
thought so.
then we'll go home?
then we'll go home.
which way?
that way.
it's the wrong way!
in this world, wrong is right!
it's here!!!
oh god...oh god...
mom?  you're alive...
of course i am.
but i don't understand...
i miss you so much, alex.  i want so much to be with you...
i love you, alex.  i never wanted to leave. you know that, don't you?
yes...but...how did you...
is...is that where we are?  did i die?
not yet, honey...
so how did you do it, alex?
well, it's a long story...
what is it?
i just thought of something.  if we came back from the game...  ...what if arcade did too?
so start at the beginning...
give her a chance, will you?
i am giving her a chance.  why don't you get off my back?
