he thinks I am "sublimating".
what the hell does that mean?
it means she is screwed up.
fucked up.  that is what they said i was.
listen to me, alex.  these counselor's do not know anything.  they are full of shit. if you do not fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
i know.
so tell me you are okay, then.
I am okay.
good.   cause I would freak if you weren't.
cool.
can you say anything but "cool"?
of course i can.  i can say all sorts of things...
come on.  we will hit dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
and then keep on driving?
sure.  never come back.  disappear forever.
we are glad you people could make it, and we are anxious to have you try out our new product.  we think it is going to be a big seller.  but you are the people that make it happen.  you are the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  it is your opinion that is going to make or break us.
so what is so different about arcade? you guys've been talking about it for months.
a man after my own heart.  straight to the point.  what is different about arcade is the way it reacts.  it responds like a human does.  it learns.  it adapts. each time you play, it changes its strategy.
that is impossible.
is it?  why do not you see for your self?
"escape"?
in case things get too intense.  it automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  things can get pretty wild...
so what is the scenario?  am i saving a princess?  fighting zombies?
it changes.  there are eleven levels. each one is a different layer of the arcade universe.  the concept is, you are entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... arcade's brain.
so how do i start?
the game will guide you.
go for it.
hold my keys, then.
so what do you think?
sign me up.
has anyone seen greg?
he is probably outside.  you know how he is. gets bored...
so where is he?
guess he took off...  you have his keys, right?
hmmm.  he said you were going to have dinner?
yeah...
so take his car home.  wait.  I am sure he is up to something...
but he was playing the game.  i mean, you saw him...
hello?
hey, kid.
nick...
have you played the game yet?  it is incredible!  i was just...
listen to me!  greg never came home. i think the game has something to do with it.
what the hell are you talking about?
i have to talk to you.
we are talking...
no, in person.  now.
it is twelve-thirty!
I am coming over.
alex, you do not know how long I have waited for this.
funny.
what do you mean by "weird"?
greg never came home.  a few hours is one thing, nick, but this is different. something is happened to him.
can you turn off the game?
I am in the middle of it...
turn if off!
happy?
no.  look, i know you are not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  i think the game's alive somehow.
no, wait.  just listen.  i hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  as soon as i turned it on, nick.  it said my name.  how could it know?  and then, i asked it where greg was, and it said, "in here".
alex, i think you are freaking out. greg's gone, I will give you that.  and maybe he is in trouble.  but it is not arcade that is doing it...
it is.
how?!  it is a machine, alex. machine's do not think.  they are not alive.  it is a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it is not alive.
so how did it know my name, then?
you imagined it.
see, men always do this.  "quiet down, honey.  chill out.  take a valium". I am not a fucking idiot, nick!  i did not imagine it!!!
quiet.  i do have parents, you know.
it turned itself back on, nick.
no it didn't.  it is just a faulty relay or something.  it happens.
sorry.  maybe i need the valium.
call the others.  laurie, benz...
something is happened to them.
it is the middle of the night.  they are asleep.  phone did not wake them.
all of them?
because i did not know where else to go.
it is two of the clock in the morning.  go home. go to sleep.  we will figure something out in the morning.
it is not this weird.  it will make sense. everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
sure.
sick?
everybody's sick, huh?  it is fifteen after.  we always meet here, you know that.
what is her problem?
did you play arcade last night?
actually, no.  i was just telling nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
we have to find out what is happened to them. i think they are gone...
no way.
if they are sick, great.  but let's make sure.  come on, nick.
okay.  we will see what is up.  but if things are cool, i do not want to hear anything more about this.  life's too short, know what i mean?
well?
she thought benz was at school.
where to now?
laurie's.
this is like a movie or something.  i mean, am i paranoid or what?
it does not necessarily mean she's...
let's go around back.
change the channel!
what?!
then leave her.
we can't...
we will call 911.  look around alex.  we broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
where do we go?
my house.  i want to try something.
that is what i thought.
what?
it is not just the cable system.  it is in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  it is everywhere.
nick, what is it.
maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  it is like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  it is self-replicating...it mimics life.
like the fractals?
it is growing.  getting stronger. maybe it is only localized now...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
right.  and then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
anywhere.  we have to stop it from getting out.
it is already out.
the police, then...
give me a break, alex.  what are we going to tell them?  excuse me, officer, but there is some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I would think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
then where do we go?!
i do not know.
slip-stream.
what?
they made arcade.  it is still a game, right?  it thinks like a game.  maybe it still has to play by the rules. someone had to program it in the first place, did not they?.
you mean we learn the rules...
and beat it at it is own game.
you realize that in order to do that, we would actually have to play the game.
i was afraid you would say that.
virgin sacrifices?
drives 'em crazy every time.
nick, alex, how are we today?
how did you know it was us?
security camera.  pulled your files before i came down. be careful what you say, kids ... i know where you live.
now what seems to be the problem?
it is the game, arcade.
you do not like it?
if this is a joke, I am not laughing.
neither are we.  something is wrong with the game, mr. difford.
why do not we take this into my office.
talk to me.
there is something wrong with arcade. the game's alive somehow...
what alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it is alive.
no I am not...
we are not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  i mean, you do not want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
this is one of our newest projects. we are trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
the air-force is working on the same thing.
does that thing work?
getting there.  it is more sensitive than a joy-stick.  your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  but what can i do for you?
we are having some problems with arcade...
yeah, who isn't.
what do you mean?
it is a tough game.  hard to pin that bastard down.  keeps on changing the rules.
we vere thinking there might be tricks. you know, surprises that you would worked into the game...
sure.  every game's got 'em.  I will start with the schematics.  i can print these up if you want.
you have got your ten levels, right? here they are...  each level has an exit, only remember, the exits are not always what they seem.  first one's the blood red sky, then you have got the blue desert, tower of ghosts, kingdom of the blind...  on each world you have to find a golden key and you have only got so much time to do it in.  if you are too late, the screamer comes.
how do you stop the screamer?
you can't.  he gets you and you are dead. it is like time catching up with you, you know?  like fate.  each level you get progressively less time to complete.  first half of the game takes place in the wild lands.  then you reach level 6, and that is the sea of darkness.  there is a two-headed boatman that will take you across if you answer his riddle right.  if you don't...
what is the riddle?
if i tell you, then it is no fun.
just tell me the fucking riddle.
well...it involves a paradox.  you have to trick the boatman.  now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  you can build that back up by catching fireflies...the little glowing guys...
the next half of the game takes place in arcade's brain, the city of truth. it is urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. screamer comes faster here.  on level four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  got to time it right though.
what is the question mark?
level ten.  that is where you have got to unlock arcade's heart using the keys you have found.
how do you do that?
good question.  see, that is where the fun comes in.  arcade changes it every time. he is a machine without a soul. once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
but how can it change every time?
it is the game's logic core.  we actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  i mean, there is a personality in there. that is what makes it so incredible.
how the hell did you do that?
well, we are veering into classified info here, but I will tell you that it involved a donor.  he was dead of course, so it is not like anything unethical was happening.
dead?
well, brain-dead anyway.  coma patient. it is really not all that important.
maybe he is not dead.
he?
the donor.  maybe he is alive inside the game.
and maybe you have been taking too many drugs.
could you play arcade with that?
well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
thanks, albert.  think you could print up those schematics?
sure.
go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. and make it quick, okay?
what are you going to do?
get that helmet.  if we are going to play arcade, i want every advantage possible.
jesus christ!
i can not believe you made it!
you got the schematics?
everything.
I have been thinking about that.  arcade's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  you know, like his point of origin?
dante's inferno.
yeah.  the inferno.
alex...
you did not hear me?
what are you looking for?
a way to hook this helmet into the game. I am sure there are interfaces...
i do not understand.  it wants us to play the game.  it is been taunting us ...
put in a quarter.
it can turn itself on, alex!  it does not need a quarter.
yes it does.  do not you see?  we have to play by the rules.  that is what it wants.
you are not coming, alex.
yes i am...
i know how to do this!  I am good at these games.  you never play, you would be nailed in an instant.
and what if something happens to you? am i suppose to go in after you alone?!
no.  if you are smart, you run like hell.
you do not get it, do you?
what?
i do not want anything to happen to you.  i care about you.
i already have a boyfriend, nick.
i know.  it sucks.
you feel it?  it is different this time.
we are actually inside, are not we?
okay.  give us a kiss?
one.  in case...
do not even say it.
thanks.  always wanted to do that.
yeah, well i figure these are unusual circumstances.
that is what i was hoping you would say.
I will take the lead and handle the physical threats.  you watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
got it.
which way do you think level two is?
you have got the schematics, check.
okay.  it is west.
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  once we get all the keys, we can unlock arcade's heart. and then...
the clock's already ticking.
right, then...
and we have still got time left.  this was a piece of cake.
yeah, that is what worries me.
hey, my strength's low.  look out for fireflies.
there...
shit...
check your read-out.
our time's up.
what?!  there is nothing here!
look around...
what the fuck is that?!
screamer.
we can not reach that!
we do not have a choice!
so that is what we almost died for?
one of them, anyway...  did you see it?  the screamer?
i do not want to talk about it.
christ...no time...
there never is.
we can take the dunes down like a ski slope. pretend you are on a snowboard.
never been on a snowboard.
one of these cities, is the place you seek. the teller of truths will take you there. but the city of lies, is dark and bleak. and death is certain if you enter, beware.
i am the liar.  where should i take you?
i am the truth teller.  where should i take you?
what did he do to you?
is that your question?
wait!  no!  that is not it!
think!  i want to go to the city of truth, and the truth teller is from there...but which one is which?  the liar...think!
you have no time.  what is your question?
I am thinking!
you have no time.
liar.  did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
i came from the city on the left.
but you always lie, so you did not come from there.  that means the city on the left must be the city of truth.
how did you get here?  did you play the game?!
yes...
thought so.
then we will go home?
then we will go home.
which way?
that way.
it is the wrong way!
in this world, wrong is right!
it is here!!!
oh god...oh god...
mom?  you are alive...
of course i am.
but i do not understand...
i miss you so much, alex.  i want so much to be with you...
i love you, alex.  i never wanted to leave. you know that, do not you?
yes...but...how did you...
is...is that where we are?  did i die?
not yet, honey...
so how did you do it, alex?
well, it is a long story...
what is it?
i just thought of something.  if we came back from the game...  ...what if arcade did too?
so start at the beginning...
give her a chance, will you?
i am giving her a chance.  why do not you get off my back?
