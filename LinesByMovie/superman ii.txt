jimmy, how's the -
yeah. i'll check.
mr. white, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
give it another ten minutes. if we don't --  hell, i'll tell him.  pete? if we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  kent,	i need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
get your head out of the clouds, kent. where you been  the last twelve hours?
uh...home...
don't you watch television? don't you listen to the radio?
actually i was trying to catch up on my reading. there's a lot of dickens i never got around to --
dickens! the whole world's about to blow up and you're reading dickens?!
a gang of terrorists seized the eiffel tower in paris
he knows where the eiffel tower is, olsen.  you do, don't you, kent?
anybody been hurt?
so far the hostages are unharmed.
hostages?
tourists, about twenty of 'em.
but . . ..that's terrible!
that's why they call 'em terrorists.  go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
does lois know about this yet?
does she know about it? she's in it!
what??
the minute the story broke i bundled her on the first concord out of here. if paris goes kablooey i want the best reporter i've got right there in the middle of it.
gee. but --
no offense, kent. you're good, but lois is the best we've got.
no, i meant, it's awfully dangerous.
and now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
in return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
there will be no attack? no attempt to overpower the terrorists?
um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
yes, but will you honor it?
we have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
superman! the --
really lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
the bomb! it's in there! any second now, its --
free!
free!
lois, i usually do.
then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
not everyone can have x-ray vision, you know.
do i detect a note of jealousy?
lois, what are you doing?
when was the last time you heard me sneeze?
uh. . .
well, you never will again!  thanks to vitamin c! i'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of vitamin c every day.
one thousand?? that's an awful lot of oranges. you know there are pill, lois. i've seen them.
oh sure. the american answer to everything. pills.  no, this is --  -- natural.
i don't?
of course not. not when you've got so much going for you.
i do?
sure! but nobody knows it. least of all you.  look, would you mind if i gave you some constructive criticism?
actually, yes.
well, you shouldn't  be more aggressive, clark! trust your instinct! when you see your opportunity, grab it! i do.
lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
haven't you heard? there's an energy crisis.  no, this was good enough for my mother --
maybe i could try --
be my guest.
clark, everything i was saying -- can't you see i only say it because i really care?
really?
of course, that's what friends are for.
don't feel bad, mr. luthor. it almost worked. i mean california almost threw up right in the ocean. millions of people almost killed. if it hadn't been for that guy superman - that overgrown boyscout...
i want my liberace record back tonight.

delete in cutting
i mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
where?
north.
why?
to ski?
otis, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. every man has a vulnerable point. some like you otis, have more that one. i didn't see superman's in time. but now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
oh! that black box in our cell?
shhhhhhh!
that little black box, mr. luthor, i mean -- what's it for?
that little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks alpha waves.
ahhhhhh -- alpha waves.

artemis? do you read me?
what'd he say before? he saw a girl?
i think he said a "curl."
what's a curl?
isn't that what the old canaveral guys used to call a comet on an east-west trajectory?
how the hell would i know? i was in high school back in those days.
strange. i tore those metal fibers like paper. and what he did . . ..  was amazing!  something is happening . . ..
yes. to all of us. the closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
delete in cutting 		) there . . .  a place called . . . houston . . .
then we must go there too.  to rule. finally - to rule!  and then you shall have what you want.
delete in cutting
and i will lead.
well done, miss teschmacher.
why am i doing this? why am i here?
is this a philosophy seminar? no. this is getaway.
lex...lex, how could you do that to otis?
what else is ballast for?
how would you like to take a little vacation? i mean you've earned it, you know? you deserve it.
there is some good in you, lex, after all.
you'll have to pack quickly.
a bikini! i'll need to buy a new bikini, lex.  c'mon. after being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
a parka.
you thought about me in a parka. that's sick, lex. really.
north!
it is kinda romantic.
in july???
'magic fingers.' fifty cents.
hah, some guys say i have magic fingers.
oh, you're a great writer, lois, nobody doubts that.
yeah, thanks. . . . i mean, really! posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in niagara falls.  i mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  perry white and his sunday magazine exposes.
but this should be exposed. they get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. that's what perry says.
a "complimentary corsage."
oh sure, everything is complimentary. until you get the bill.
i was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  sleeping arrangements.
mr. smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
i don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
that's because you can hardly see through those things.
hey, are you hungry? i'm hungry.
lois, you're amazing.
aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
no. i mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. aren't you impressed?
frankly, once you've seen superman in action, niagara falls tends to leave you cold.
where were you?
i was getting hot dogs. what do you mean?
i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around, you disappear.
superman? oh, was he here?
and you weren't. as usual. what do you say to that?
lois, i don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
don't fake me out, clark.  or whoever you are.
whoever, i  look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. i'ii meet you back at the motel.
who ????
listen, i've got to give you credit. your disguise is nearly perfect. i mean, if you fooled me, and i am nobody's fool --
no, of course not, lois. you just get carried away sometimes. believe me, i understand --
you've been under a lot of pressure lately -
uh-uh.  listen, i'll tell you what. you say i'm wrong. and i say i'm right. so why don't we make a little bet on it?
how could you win a crazy bet like --
because of what i'm betting.  my life.
what??
oh clark, no!
lois, help! i can't --  i can't swim -- !
so this is the planet houston . . .
what shall we do now?
stay. i will come to you.
it's true. it's true.
lois, i . . .
i was right. you are superman.
oh come on, that's ridic -
you don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  how could i . . .
maybe you wanted to.
i didn't think i wanted to.
well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
i'm in love with you. how do you feel?
we'd better talk.
i'm listening.
not here, perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
"what's happening." oh, is that the understatement of the year. well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
i guess it would be all right if -  lois, now that you know me, i think you ought to know it all.
i want to.
let's go to my place.
let's go to my place.
your place?  maybe i should change,  maybe you should, too.
mush!  mush!
look at this! snow. ice.  your idea of a good time.
a good time! is that all you care about?!
i wouldn't know. i've never had one.
this way lex.
it' s fantastic! ----- this place is genius.
genius!  --  lex.
i'll be alright.
no, me, me, me. thank you.
it's beautiful.
it's beautiful.
it has everything.
wrong.
why didn't you go before we left?
that was two days ago. frankly, i think this place is a bit boring. it's all white. why doesn't the guy put up some posters? maybe some bullfight things . . .
it's beautiful.
i like trees.
so does your average cocker spaniel. give me another one.  under . . . the big one there.
-- as the keeper of the archives of krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
now this i want to hear.
for many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on earth are classified as "criminals."
my kind of people.
the three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. now as you know, we had no death penalty -
sensible enough.
and so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the phantom zone. in it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
no possibility for parole?
the elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
i asked the right question.
the one danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. i cannot say i am glad you asked me that -
i didn't ask her anything . . .
you'll miss the battle of the century!
good. my heart can't take it.
your heart, miss teschmacher? i never knew you had one.
you must be freezing.
i must be. but i'm not.  your home. this is your home.
well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  until now.
so --  i hope you like it.
like it? it's magnificent!  not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. especially around dinner time.
dinner. oh yes.  i'm sorry, i just never do much about that.  but tonight -- i mean, anything you want, lois.
i never did this before . . . i have to tell you.
hey, don't worry. you'll be fine, just . . . well, don't rush it.
it must be tough, having to be clark kent.
oh no.  i really like it sometimes.  and if it weren't for him, i wouldn't have met you.
but him is you.  now i'm confused.
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, kal-el. could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
selfish! but they get a chance at happiness. can't i have that chance?
you have been given a higher form of happiness. the happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
yes, but it's not all i feel.
patience, kal-el. you begin to sound like an earthling. superman mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
because that is your heritage. those are the values we lived by on krypton.
but you had more than that, and i know it. you and my father --  you had each other.  can i never have what you had?
and she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
yes.
look, they need a machine to fly.
brave young heroes. be nice to them, my dear. blow them a kiss.
you did it. you gave it all up for me. i . . . i don't know what to say.
say you love me.
i'm the man they're 	protecting. i'm the president. i'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
it will. starting with your own.
who is this imbecile? where is he?
i wish i knew. --  oh, god.
zod.  zod.
clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
let's get you inside . . . .
maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
i don't want a bodyguard. i want the man i fell in love with.
i know that, lois. and i wish he were here . . .
who is this . . . superman?
you'll find out, general! and when you do . . .
come to me, superman! if you dare! i defy you! come! come, and kneel before zod!
i have to go back . . .to the fortress . . .
but what can you do? there's no way now . . .
i have to try, dammit! something, anything . . .
don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
he knew. i heard him. i just didn't listen.
you are master of all you survey.
and so i was yesterday. and the day before.
wait, wait, wait just a moment. wait till you've got to know better will you please.  wait, -- look, i can give you anything you want. i can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus lex luthor's savvy. lex luthor's career guidance... lex luthor's school of...
we have all of this without you. you cannot bargain with what you don't have.
oh magnificent one. what i am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of jor-el.
no, jor-el, the baseball player that came from porto rico. yes jor-el your jailer.
the son of jor-el on this planet?
oh my fullness, as i explained to you before, i am about the best there is. second best there is.
revenge! we will kill the son of our jailer!
he flies as well, then . . .
constantly.
he has powers as we do . . .
certainly. but - er. oh magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
we will bring him to his knees!
oh, general, the world is a big place. thank goodness, my needs are small...as  it turns out, i have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
what do you want?
australia.
i can't understand it! where is he? i mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
game plan! it's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! how brilliant do you have to be?!
superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. we just haven't figured it out. isn't that right, miss lane?
this "super" man is nothing of the kind. i have discovered his weakness.
yes?
he...  cares. he actually cares about these . . . . . .these people. these earth people .
sentimental idiot.
he's captured non!
don't worry. i will draw his fire.  with a few of my own.
you said it. three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
he ran in fear from us . . .
why do you say this to me when you know i will kill you for it?
kill me? lex luthor? extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? eradicate the only man on earth . . .
there is something more you want. the 								greed is written on your face.
perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									ultimate. a tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
what more?
cuba.
no drinks . no movie. this is the last time i take a charter flight.
where is his home, lex luthor? which way?
north. keep going north!
put down lex luthor !
put down lex luthor?
general --- ?
we must combine our strength.
did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
"super-sucker . " for once, lex luthor was right.
hey, let's be fair. actually, there've been two or three times --
now i shall have the son of jor-el as my slave! forever. if not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  beginning with this one.
perhaps there is some good in you after all, lex luthor.
me? i'm loaded with good! i mean i've never even used it.
i'll have to take the chance. try to get them all into that molecule chamber. it takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. now if you could . . .
wait! don't go in! it's a trap!
luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
i knew you'd double-cross me, luthor. a lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
are you kidding? i knew it all the time. did you see how they fell into our trap? beautiful . . .
too late, luthor. too late . . .
listen. have i got a proposition for you, superman. i mean i owe you one, you know? now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
which one would you like to join, luthor? pick a hole.
wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, superman. we can take a lunch on this --
hi.
oh, hi.
sleep well?
never closed my eyes.
i know, i know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. that's what i did all night -- i "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
i'm sorry.
me too, oh, i tried to convince myself, believe me, "it's like being married to a doctor," i said. doctors are practically never at home. the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? or are you too selfish . . . "
you're not selfish at all.
oh, when it comes to you i am. not that i don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than i do.
"they?"
everybody. everybody else. i'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. all the ones who say "help. come quick. now" i know who you'd have to pick.
what else could i do?
oh, i'm not blaming you.  i just know me. i'd be jealous. jealous of . . . of all humanity.  some rival, huh?
lois, someday --
please don't tell me "you'll find somebody else someday." cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  oh, i'll get by, don't worry about me.
i like worrying about you.
are you okay?
she'll be fine.
see what happens when i don't have my orange juice?  the human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
take it easy. take a deep breath.
i'm fine. . . . . .  what  was i talking about?  before?
. . . superman?. . . . .
lois, i really don't see why --
clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. nobody expects you to be what you're not.
i'll try to remember that . . .
well, you should. because i appreciate you, too, you know.
you do?
sure. especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
everything on it?
everything on it.
