i already tossed that out.  somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. of course, that is none of my business.
do not make it less true.
do you call it a game when only one man win each time? i think you call it a damn shame.

been years since i fooled with that.  you know a white girl? dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
that am not up to me to hook you up. naw what i mean? she her own, you know?
huh?
i do not pimp that.  you talkin' about who i think you talkin' about, you mean rae. rae doole. sexy little split tail, like you say. i can not hook you up with that. i got two girls. one am not in town, the other one pregnant. so... you on your own.
this rae... you get with her?
shit. who hasn't?
why you say that?
she got a spare minute she will snatch up anyone... but me, I am different. sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. girl got an itch. you know... what is a nigga to do?
she like it rough? you like beatin' on her?
that am not my scene. if that is somethin' you into...
now, hold up.

well i don't...
wait. he left.
i do not got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
do not need none.
then i better be on my way. do not wanna put you out no more.

naw'sir... i got to be on my way.
best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
let me say somethin' first...
why you got me chained?
way i see it, it is going to take a while for you to get right.
the fuck you been doin' to me?
i am not laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... remember like i say, i found you in the road...

now, no harm's come to you... and i aim to keep it that way. am not gonna... going to run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I would be chasin' you all night.
well I am woke now... you can take this off.
gal, you am not right yet.
I am right enough to stand on my own two feet. now take this goddamn chain off...
how you let men treat ya like they do?

these men you up under. how you let them do ya like that?
do me? do me like this, you mean? like chainin' me up?
you know what I am talkin' about.  all that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
the hell you know about me?! you got no right to talk to me about that shit! the hell you think you are?
I have saved ya life, gal. i can do and say whatever the fuck i want.
i give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. get you to the kitchen. you need the bathroom, it will reach.
what do you want?
we got everything we need. plenty of food. ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
what do you want from me?!  whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!
god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
you some kind'a pervert?
no ma'am.
some crazy jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
in my house, you watch that lip...
look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I will do whatever you want. but you got to let me go. you can not do this! you can not keep me here!
you sick. you got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
let me go!
you can holla y'self hoarse. am not going to bend my will.  right or wrong, you going to mind me.  going to suffer you like jesus say, to the faithless and the perverse generation.
now you get up! and you get in my house!
or what?
stop it! stop it! it hurts!
whose doin' is that?
wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
you going to get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
no, ma'am. you stop that foolishness.
hm-mm... hm-mm...
i said... stop!
i can't!
you like this? walkin' me through this field like i's your mule?
can not sit all day on that sofa. need to get your legs strong.
if i break one you gonna shoot me?
my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. that is a group of farmers, you know, each season they would rotate the crop. know why it is best to rotate em like that?
uh-uh.
cuz once in a while soil need a change. corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. that give off a lot of nitrate. change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  sting a bit?
itches.
means ya healin'.  so all this farmin' make me think on matthew. matthew 13. the parable of the sower? man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
uh-uh.
the seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of god... and understand the word of god. not enough for you to hear what I am sayin', you got to understand.
i know. i get it. what is matthew doin'?
gal... matthew am not doin' shit... this just a story...  look it. I have seen it in nature, I have seen it in men. ya got to change up your crop. cuz that seed am not gettin' in.  ya got to cut this shit out. got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. like you somebody is dog. no woman... who joins in union with almighty god... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to another man's will!
my god, gal, do not you got no sense? i am not sayin' i am not weak? shit. playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  i got sin in me! i am not go'n lie! but i got respect! and all you got is bile, gal!
let go of me...
givin' up that switch like a tramp! behind my back and kill my baby...!
and, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you are lookin' for?
that young lady's size, right'cher.
well, that makes it easier.
mind i ask, what is all this business here?
these are whipped body creams. it is like a lotion.
for your hands?
some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. so now they have scented creams. they help moisturize a woman's skin.  this one's my favorite. it is called ginger souffle. i recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. so... perhaps just after a shower.
I will take a jar of that, too.
i brung you a little basket of goodies. fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
you did not have to do this.
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day. my niece, she is cured up, and i got you to thank.
well that is good. I am happy to hear it.
this was very sweet of you.
well. hope you enjoy it.
was that lincoln james i seen run off?
he is fine. just had a bad fall.
why is his britches round his knees?
r.l., you going to have to get on. i can not have nobody round my place.
you get a call from rose?
this am not got nothin' to do with that woman. just do not want nobody around me now.
somethin' wrong with ya phone? been callin' the last few days.
goin' dove huntin'?
you got to go, r.l.. i am not foolin' this time.
you sayin' that gun's for me if i don't?
you am not going to talk me outta shit no more. i got my mind made up and i am not going to be moved on this.
am not going to be moved?
got no place for preachin' here. not now. so you do as i say...
or what?
i told you to turn back!
are you outta ya goddamn mind?
man like you ought not take the lord's name like you just done.
a naked woman, chained in ya house?
I am tellin' you the truth, dammit. i found her beat. left for dead. so i brung her home.
laz, i know about that girl.  good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  oh, laz. she is had a mess of crabs and them std's. what'chu thinking?
i have not laid a hand. on my life, r.l., my wick is dry on this.
you say she was beat on. you call the sheriff on that?
put yo'self in my shoes. say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. i been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
what is that chain around her for?
why do not you go'on and ask her. she need to talk wit somebody with sense. folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. and this is how I am handling it.
this is how you handling it? this is how you handling it?
good. makin' steaks for supper. i expect you to come.
you mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
you treat folks special when they company. it is just supper, r.l., shit.
one thing at a time, laz.
what happened in there... that will not your fault. am not a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
why she got a chain on her?
that is between her and me. it is private. and i do not want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
please do not tell my daddy.
my mouth is shut, boy. and that is how we going to keep it. do not go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
so...  that your first time?
yes'sir.
you struck some gold, did not ya?
thank you.
i got to ask you. why do you think laz is keepin' you chained like this?
you know how, like they say, you save someone is life, you responsible for them. guess he just do not think it is safe for me.
so he got it into his head that the only thing going to keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  you think he is crazy for thinkin' that?
you a preacher?
that is right.
can i ask you a question?  people always say, you gotta get good with jesus, if you want not to go to hell. that you say sorry for all you done and... and jesus would let you go on to heaven.
you could put it that way.
but that is so fuckin' stupid.  I am sorry. did not mean to curse.
what is on your mind?
you can not hurt people... and then just say, I am sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. why would heaven want people like that. people who... do what they want and then... switch.
I am going to tell you somethin', and it is just going to be between you and me.  i think folks carry on about heaven too much. like it is some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. and folks just going to do as they are told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. i can go to shoney's for that.
now that is sharp. that is sharp. chain give you any trouble?
uh-uh.
good. now i got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. r.l. and lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. what do you know how to make?
i do not fuckin' cook.
gal, i been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. and let me tell you...
look it... i put the goddamn dress on, did not i? i think I am handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
if all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just going to tune ya out.  rae. rae! I am not fightin' with ya. i just know you got more in you than junk.  now, you sayin' you do not know how to cook anything at all?  you know how to boil water?
i can handle that.
well, get to it.
pass them potatoes, lincoln.
you all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
this all looks wonderful.
i skipped lunch.
well, dig in, son. got plenty to eat.
mm. mm. now these eggs got some kick to it. what'chu got in this?
ask the chef.
holy shit.
yeah.
sit down, man. need a beer?
sure.
marv, let's get ronnie set up here.
what happened?
they been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. like how it was just before we would play ball back in school. thought it was just some tic i got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  i can't... shoot. target practice I am a pro. i tag between the numbers each time but...  but when there is really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. i get shaky and... i lose my breath. they called it anxiety. severe anxiety. it can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  it is a long process but... they sent me home.
i guess it could be worse. you could be comin' back in a body bag.
i can not get rae on the phone. she is not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
she is around. always is.
i do not know. she is gettin' crazy, like she gets. begged me not to go. got real down. i just think somethin's happened. like she run off with someone. you would tell me if you knew somethin', right?
you been home yet?
uh-uh. i's hitchin' up the interstate when i seen your truck outside.
you need a ride?
this do not feel right. kitchen looks just like i left it. i know, cuz i cleaned it.
she ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
i just been so mixed up lately, gill. and, you know, with her history, i can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
ronnie. you can not see cuz you are too close to it.  these nervous spells you get. you never had that shit back in school...
that is not right, really, cuz i...
you joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. army'd pay for school. you were going to get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were going to make somethin' of yourself.
and then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
now wait...
with all she was doin'. with all the shit she kept doing! you stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you would not let go.
i know about how she was like. but we was different. i's the only person she talked to about it. how she is abused. terrible things, gill, just terrible...
you had a plan! you had a goddamn life! and she just fucked the guts out of you!
it is not her fault, gill. she is had to take care of me all this time, cuz I would just start throwin' up... choking. just losin' my grip. and she listened. she listened to me.  and... i got better. i do not get nervous like i used to. and since we been together... she been faithful to me. put all that junk behind her...
the only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  your first night away, i come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. you were not gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
you gonna steal my truck?
make yourself at home. you done it already.
got to get that chain off her, laz. somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
I am dealin' with what god put before me.
you believe he wants this? a woman chained to ya radiator?
not like that.
then what?
she is tied to me, r.l.. we tied to each other.
they sure liked them devilled eggs.
you drink whiskey?
you take it straight?
sure.
want another?
we drinkin' buddies now?
to freedom.
still makin' jokes?
no joke.
if you want... i can take you back to town now.
i am not in a hurry.
could you do somethin' for me?
anything.
my life is gone. only life i was livin'. and i lost it.
I am here with you.
i had love in my heart. and i gave it to one woman. and she gone now.  where am i gonna put all this love?
tell me what to do.
the... chain helps.
i seen a man die. he could not breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
you just havin' a fit. you am not goin' nowhere.
he told me... get help. i just stood there and watched him... i watched him die, laz. oh god! goddammit!
oh, laz... he hurt me. he... hurt me so many times.
no one's going to hurt you no more.
you think god forgives people like that?  you think god forgives people like me?
where you gonna be?
right here. be here all afternoon.  you ready for this?
I am going to just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
i bet you have loyal customers.
you liked what i brung ya?
been eatin' like a princess all week. even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
that would be nice.
i put on the lotion you got me. can you smell it?
what happened to your face?
got in a little accident.
yeah.
since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
you need money again?
no. that is not why...  why we always got to do this? i mean, you and me been at each other as far back as i can remember. was not no love between us. and I am your daughter. I am the only family you got.
you never needed nobody. always made that clear to me.
yeah. i know i did. but...  I am tryin' to be dif'rent. I am tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I am workin' here, rae. can you see that?
i just wanted some make-up.
all that shit's on aisle 5.
i just think you should'a kept him off me, that is all.
the hell are you talkin' about?
now see? do not do that. I will go along with all you say about me. but that... you can not pretend no more on that. cuz i was just a kid, momma.  i did not know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  and you let him do it. some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only somebody you had.
I am sorry... i did not mean to shout...
all my life i been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. and you going to lay the blame at my feet? well, i am not going to take that.
but... momma... just tell me... not going to be mad... we can just talk about it... be eye to eye on this... you do not even got to say you are sorry... just say how you knew...
only thing I am sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what i should'a done.
i's thinkin' about singing in the choir.

looks like you know a song.
do not know where i learn't it, but... it is there in my head.
how you feelin' today?
you know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? like your eyes can open a little bit more.
i know that.
woke up real early. sun was shining. just thought I would mess around, try to learn a song.
go'on and sing it, I will play.
no, you do it. i can not sing.
stop that foolishness. just do as i say and close your eyes.  close your eyes. and think about... well, for a song like this, I would say you think about what you love.
what i love.
get a good picture in your mind.
am not been a week and you already some nigger's whore? gill told me. told me how you and he... you and everybody...
ronnie. please, baby...
did 'ya have fun with her? sweet as a peach, i bet. huh? huh?
goddamn it, i ask you a question, you better answer it, or I am going to blast a hole in ya!
ronnie...
you shut up!
careful how you point that gun, boy.
or what? or what?
boy? you here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
am not going to be callin' me boy when i blow your face off.
you sayin' you will do what?
you heard me, mother-fucker. I will fuckin' kill..
boy! you so green you could not stomp a baby duck.
you testing me? huh? you testin' me, old man?
test. shit. what kind'a test you thinkin'? you mean like, if you a man or not? if you a killer? only one way to prove that. you just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
goddammit, rae!
boy! you keep that gun pointed at me!  you need to kill a man, all you got to have is a good reason.  you know she been here with me, do not cha? been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
shut up! shut up!
put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. that is a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. she would fear ya then. cuz there will not be no more question in her mind. she with a real man now. a real killer!
don't... do not say that to me...
son, I am grown. do not got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I am too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. so let's have it. end me or get out of my face!
like a man.
yes. i mean that is it. i wanna feel like a man with her. i wanna feel like the only man with her.
it starts like this... fire... that spreads. starts in my head. then moves to my stomach. then it goes lower. i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when i met ronnie.  cuz i love him so much. he is all i got in my life that is special. and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. when i can do that for him... it is like I am givin' somethin' of myself that i have not givin' nobody else.
rae, look at ronnie. and tell him how you feel.
hey.
hey. you was not at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. hope you do not mind me comin' over.
what do you need?
i need ya help again.
more cough syrup?
can i come in?
i lied to you. it was wrong. but at the time... i did not know what to do. imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal i's carryin'...
laz... you do not need to explain yourself to me...
yes, i do. cuz i feel for you. mean to say...  i got feelings for you. and i did not want you to think... i didn't...  i do not want you to go away. there is better ways to say what I am trying to say, but... they it is. do not go away.
laz. I am going to put my trust in you. I am going to do it knowin' all too well i can get hurt like this. and i have been hurt. just like you.  woman like me, i got a lot of livin' to do. but my days are precious to me. they all i got left. do not want no more fuss. i want love in my life. you understanding me, laz?
i do. god's truth. i do.
it got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. got fresh 22's on her. am not my doin'. that is just how it came to me. do not worry. nobody going to come lookin' for it. i got the pinks... got no problem.  am not going to have my girl ridin' no bus.
do not see generosity much these days. everything always got a catch. guess I am tryin' to say... thank you.
nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. and you know what? I am good at it. naw what i mean?
what are you doing?
just wanted to see.
you know the rules.  you do know the rules, do not you?
yeah, i know.
then start taking them seriously.
yes, ma'am.
now that is sharp. that is real sharp. miss ella mae set you up, did not she? you like it?
I have had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow.
well, this one's yours now. you ready to take care of it?
i do not want you to let go.
maybe i won't.
and now these three remain: faith, hope and love. but the greatest of these is love.  who gives this girl in marriage?
i do.
