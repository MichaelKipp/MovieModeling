salvy, would i steer you wrong? let's say that is the truck; it is full of cigarettes, right? now, two of the clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
hey but joey, you are thinking nickels and dimes. the money's with your brother.
what do you want from my life, salvy? he is my brother.
he am not doin' the right thing. he is makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. can not you make him understand that?
hey, leave the kids alone.
get lost.  hey kids, "a cop is a rat." remember that, "a rat."
this looks done.
it is not done.
it looks done. I will take it the way it is.
here's your steak. you can not wait for it to be done. here.
here's your carrots. you are in such a hurry. you can not wait.
no, i can not wait. you know when i wait? when it is important to wait. it is not important to wait for no steak. it is important to wait for reeves to leave the ring. it am not important to wait for no steak! i won that fight. so, i stayed in the ring, and that way i made sure everybody knew it. i shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
i can not convince him. he is got such a thick head, I would like to crack it open myself. believe me, my own brother. it is very hard. you do not have to convince me -- i know we should be with tommy. you talk to him. he do not listen to nobody.
look, I am just tellin' you how tommy feels. jake is makin' it hard on himself. tommy wants him with us. it is as simple as that.
talk some sense into him, will ya? you are still his brother. if he am not going to listen to you, he am not going to listen to nobody!
all right, I will try. see you later.
tomorrow, at the gym. do not forget.
right, the gym.
what is wrong?
nothing...
hey, c'mon, what is the matter?
i am not ever going to fight joe louis, that is what is the matter.
what are you talking about? he is a heavyweight. you are a middleweight.
that is what I am sayin'. you should not even think like that. it is crazy.
i tell you one thing. ok, I will never be big enough to fight louis, but i know joey, i know...
you know?
yeah. do me a favor.
sure. what is it?
hit me in the face.
you want me to do what?
you heard me, i said hit me.
c'mon, jack. you had a few drinks.
go ahead. i am not drunk. take your best shot. on the jaw.
jack, i got no gloves.
here's your glove.
harder.  take the towel off.
jack! enough!
go ahead.
what was that for? i know you can take punches. i can hit you from now to doomsday. what the fuck does that prove?
see that, i do not feel it. i can take it. i know i can take anybody.
answer me when i talk to you.
yeah, yeah. they just wanted to talk to you. so i...
do not ever bring those kids up here again! I am working out, I am killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
and that hard-on, salvy. who is he think he is? I am going to let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
what are you getting so hot about -- tommy como told him to come down here...
hey, i do not care about tommy como. i do not care about jesus christ on the fuckin' cross. i got to give them a percentage of what i make! I am in here breaking my ass, not them. do not ever bring them up here again.
i did not tell them to come. tommy como...
who is that?
whadda you care?
whadda ya mean, whadda i care? who is she? what is a matter? you afraid I am going to take her on you?
no, I am not afraid. why? you wanna meet her?
yeah --
cause I will go right over there and bring her here.
go 'head.
you sure you wanna meet her? do not make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she is really a knockout. she is 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
how do you know? you know her that good?
no, i see her around the pool. i know her. i know her like that -- not like that.
nah, not now... i wanna wait. i do not feel right...
I am tellin' you, she will be there, i know she will be there.
'cause i wanna catch her alone.
how you going to catch anybody alone at a dance?... i do not know if she will be there alone... she will probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
she ever go with them? like salvy?
nah, she do not go with nobody. she is only 15 years old.
what does that have to do with it? she do not look 15 to me. i heard somethin' with salvy. she was with him once or somethin', i think. it was like some blonde. that is the one...
probably. you know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
yeah, she is nice.
ah, some piece of ass, I am tellin' you.
you was not with her, were you?
huh?
you was not with her?
with her? how?
you know, like bang her or anything?
ah, no, no. i did not bang her. i know her from around here, that is all. you want to meet her or what?
nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I will wait. not now.
I am tellin' you, she will be there, i know she will be there. dressed up and everything.
i do not like all those other clowns around. that is all i know.
c'mon, hurry up. we are never going to get outa here tonight.
where you going at this hour?
what are you, a cop? I am goin' out -- business.
you fuckin' worm, if you are going out, I am going out.
and where you goin'?
none of your fuckin' business.
hey, watch your mouth. do not talk like that. she is still my wife.
no, but jake... how much abuse can you take.
how many times do i have to hit her? i hit her enough.
do you see her yet?
give me a chance. let me look.
joey said you wanted to meet me. is that right? you wanted to meet me?
i just wanted to say hello.
you wanted to say hello, eh? i can not believe it. when did you fall outa heaven? anyone ever tell you you are the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. you got a baby face. look at mine. whatcha wanna meet me for?
i do not know. 'cause you are cute.
ya hear, joey? she thinks this face is cute? hey, whatcha doin' now? you wanna go for a ride?
you do not talk very much.
i am not ever talked to a movie star before.
i am not no movie star. I am just in high school.
oh no? i thought you was a movie star.
you go first. let me watch how to do this.
you do not get nothin' done by watchin'. you just got to do it. here, I will help you.
that is it. just grip up a little tighter. that is it. you are going to be real good at this. how does that feel?
it feels real good.
just keep your eye on the ball.
should i hit it?
just give it a nice little tap.
i can not find my ball.
can you see it?
can you see it?
no.
what does that mean?
jake, this is your father's bedroom.
that is all right. he do not mind.
jake...
it is ok.
I am tellin' you now, when i read this, it better not make me look bad.
jake, did i ever make you look bad before?
maybe it was not you, but you know what I am talkin' about.
why not? there is nobody else around who wants to fight me; they are all afraid. i do not see why i should not have a shot at the title right now.
well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in new york. and they are saying that you do not cooperate.
you guys know more about that than i do. i just fight...
he fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
I am the only guy ever to beat sugar ray, and i still do not have a shot at the title.
you just fought sugar ray two weeks ago and you are training like this right now... are you afraid sugar ray might beat you this time?
i tell you what. you hit me here.  sugar ray hits me here.  i can not tell the difference. i just fight.
are you sure we should be doing this?
come over here.
you said never to touch you before a fight.
if you let me do it, I will murder you. come here.
you said i couldn't. you have been good for two weeks...
come here.
take off my pants.
jake...
do what i say.
now take the rest off.
jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
go 'head. do it.
i like the gym smell.
now take your panties off.
now, touch me...  ...here.
oh, jake.
they robbed us! those fuckin' judges -- what the fuck fight were they watching? if i see them on the street, I will break their heads. decision robinson, my fuckin' ass! those judges give him the decision 'cause he is goin in the army next week! how else could this have happened?... what do you think they gave him the decision for, that is why.
whadda i got to do, joey? i knocked him down. what did i do wrong? i do not understand.
you won and was robbed! you did not do nothin' wrong.
i dunno. maybe i do not deserve to win. I have done a lot of bad things. i dunno...
you want us to wait for you?
no, take her home. i wanna be alone for a while. everybody go.
i just weighed myself -- I am 161. no more deals like this janiro bullshit. i did not tell you to do it in the first place.
jake, you are the one who said you could get down to 155! what did i do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
well, sometimes you should not listen to me! now i do not know if i can make it down to 155. I am having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if i do not make 155, i forfeit $15,000! you are supposed to know what you are doin'. you are supposed to be a manager!
you want the title shot?
say what you are going to say.
you want the title shot or not?
say what you got to say. do not be a smart ass.
this janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you got to knock out. knockout this fuckin' kid! I am telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. listen to me: I am telling you. you been killin' yourself for three years. there is nobody left -- they are afraid to fight you. this janiro's up-and- coming. he do not know. fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! what are you worried about? your weight? look, even if you lose they are going to think you are weak; they are going to think you are not the fighter you used to be. they will match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you will kill them and you will get your title shot. and if you beat this kid janiro, they got to give you a shot at the title because there is nobody else. either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. all right?
joey's right. janiro's up-and coming, he is good looking...
what do you mean, "good looking?"
well, he is popular. a lotta people like janiro. you beat him and it only figures they will wanna see you get a title shot. but, what do i know? i should keep my mouth shut, i should...
who asked you?
but, jake, i was just...
who asked you?
i was just...
who asked you?
what are you lookin' at? you lookin' at him?
no, I am not. I am looking at you.
do not tell me "no." i saw you lookin' at him. why, you like him?
I am not interested in him.
you are not interested in him?
no, I am not.
in other words, you are not interested in him but you would be interested in somebody else, right?
jake, c'mon now. do not start.
look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' romeo around here. did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
nah, she would never...
did not you just see her lookin' at him? she told me no, but i do not believe her.
c'mon, jake. you know she is crazy about you.
excuse me for a minute. be right back.
do not be long. I am afraid with all these tough guys here.
hi, tommy. how are you?
jake, sit down for a minute.
fuckin' kid! you are the best fuckin' fighter around. loved what you did to satterfield. them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. they are all afraid to fight you.
c'mon, tommy --
how you feelin'? ok? you feelin' good?
never felt better.
tony janiro's got to watch out, eh?
he should.
this janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
how is the weight? ok?
yeah, the weight's ok.
all right, lemme ask you something. let's say i was a good friend of yours. and i was telling you i was going to bet a lot of money on you in this janiro fight. what would you tell me?
I would tell you to bet a bundle.
vickie?... vickie, you asleep?
what?
you asleep?
yeah.
huh?
yeah, what?
tell me, you think of anybody else when I am making love to you?
nobody. i love you, remember?
then why did you say that thing about tony janiro?
what did i say?
that he is got a pretty face.
i never noticed his face.
you sure you are not thinking of him right now?
positive.
you are the one who said he was good looking. you think he is good looking 'cause i know you think he is good- looking. I will smash his face inside out. I will make him into dog meat. nobody's going to think he is good-looking when i get through with him. so you just go ahead and think about who you want.
what are you doin' with salvy? you should not be here with him. jake's away killin' himself. suppose he found out.
what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training, i can not go out? what am i, a goddamn prisoner?
no, you are his wife.
I am not doing anything wrong. I am just trying to have a good time. do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
it do not look right.
well, go ahead, tell jake. he is going to kill me anyway. it is a matter of time.
I am not going to tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. what is the matter with you? are not you happy? you got everything you want.
you do not sleep with him. i do. i do not get to breathe without tellin' him. he keeps me in a cage. if he thinks I am lookin' at somebody the wrong way, i get used as a punching bag. he do not trust nobody. if he saw the two of us talking together right now, you would be in trouble too -- believe me. look at me, joey. I am 19 years old. i wanna enjoy my life. i love jake, but you do not know. he gets crazy sometimes. I am scared.
try to understand, vickie. jake's got a lotta aggravation. he is been a top contender too long.
that is right, take his part. you are his brother. he is never going to be champ. too many people are against him.
and you are drinking with them right now.
and I am going to finish my drink. and, I am going to have a good time, because i am not doing nothing wrong.
i said, let's go.
joey, relax. you are taking this the wrong way. why do not you sit down and have a drink?
excuse me, I am talking to my sister in-law.
excuse me for living.
what do you think, I am blind? my brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you are here with his wife.
hey joey, I am here with patsy and vera and sandy. and vickie just happened to come along. we are just trying to have a good time. what do you want from me? so, why do not you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
hey joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
I will suck your eyes out! I will fuckin' take the two of you.
all right. i do not have to hear any more. i think i understand what happened. i understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I am not sayin' salvy should not have acted the way he did. but, joey, you do not raise your hands. you do not do that kind of thing. this time we forget about it but no more after this. you understand?
yeah, i understand, tommy.
all right, you guys, shake hands.
aside from everything else, your family all right?
yeah, they are good. they are good, tommy.
what is it with you? can not you talk? you got like a funny attitude. i can not figure you out, joey. what is with you and the quick answers? you wanna get outa here fast?
aw, tommy, c'mon, it am not that.
look joey, i wanna tell you something. your brother am not going to get nowhere without us -- nowhere. and I am tellin' you between the two of us, it is gettin' to the point where it is gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
how can he embarrass you?
he is an embarrassment because frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I am lookin' very bad. i can not deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. why is he make it so hard on himself? he comes to me, i can make it easier for him.
tommy, jake respects you. he will not even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. but you know when jake gets set on somethin', jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he am not going to talk him out of it. I am his kid brother. i got no say with jake on this. he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money. he thinks he is going to become champ on his own? we are going to sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who do not listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen, joey, you understand, you tell him. i do not care how great he is or how colorful. he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to. he am not going to get a shot at the title without us. I am not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
whatcha doin'?
i remember the first time i met vickie... i know there is somethin' up. i know she is doin' somethin', but i can not catch her...
maybe she is afraid you are going to hit her so she can not talk to you the way she wants to.
what do you mean?
try talkin' to her. she is your wife -- ask her what is the matter.
when I am away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? tell me the truth.
jack, if there was anything funny, i would tell you.
i want you to keep an eye on her when I am not here. understand?
sure, I will keep an eye on her.
what did tommy say?
i got good news, and i got bad news. the good news is you got your shot at the title. the bad news is...
yeah, i know.
what is up, colonel?
I would like to talk to jake a minute.
what who is been sayin'?
you were a big favorite in this fight. then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you are a 12-5 underdog.
i do not follow no gamblin' commissioner. I am just a fighter.
now the fight's off the books altogether. meyer lansky could not get a bet down on this fight. some people are saying you are going into the tank.
believe what you want.
i want to believe you, lamotta.
I am going to kill him. that fuckin' jig's going to wish he never came outa the jungle. you got any money?
what?
you got any money you want to bet on billy fox, you can put it right here...  'cause jake lamotta do not go down for nobody.
do not fight anymore!  it is a free country, do not fight anymore!
why did they have to stop it? why did they have to stop it?
stick out your hands, jake.
c'mon, joey.
g'wan, do it.  protect yourself, rummy.
see? that is all there was to it.
what the fuck they want? i took the dive. they want me to fall down too? i do not fall down for nobody. i never went down in my life. joey, what do i got to do? crawl on my hands and knees? i made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' garden! all the newspaper writers make fun of me. I am the bum of the year. all i want is a shot. just a fuckin' shot. what do i got to do? I will do anything.
except fall down like a normal person.
yeah, except fall down. that is right.
all right, you do not wanna fall down, so now you got to take a rest. so, you enjoy the suspension. 'cause there is nothin' you can do about it. let the commissioner and the d.a. jerk you around. so you wait.
jesus christ! seven months! what am i going to do for seven months? I am going to go crazy. how do i keep my strength? by that time I will be too weak to win the title. and my weight? forget about it -- I am going to blow up like a balloon. i am not never going to hold my weight down. seven months! i do not know...
we did what we had to do. tommy do not forget. sooner or later you will get your shot -- if tommy do not die.
I am going to order up some stuff. have a steak.
i can not eat a steak. if i eat a steak, I am going to have trouble making the weigh-in.
so eat just a little. you gotta eat something.
what am i going to do for 24 hours? i can not even eat!
hey champ!
tommy, thanks for coming over.
you just take it easy, now. you will do all right. feelin' ok?
I am ok.
just come by to wish you luck.  need anything?
no, we are all right. thanks anyway, tommy.
ok, champ.
hey, you do not say goodbye to him like that.
what did i do?
you do not kiss like that. hello and goodbye, that is all you do.
all i did...
you know what I am talking about. do not ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
you are hurting my arm.
but jake... i did not say anything...
do not ever do that again. you do not  do it!
jake...
what is the matter with you?
tryin' to get this fuckin' tv to work. paid all this money for it and still can not get a station a mile away. and mr. wizard here am not no help.
screw you, jack.
where you been?
i went out.
what is that kissing on the mouth shit?
what? i just said hello. since when i can not kiss my sister-in-law?
am not a cheek ever good enough for you? i never even kissed mama on the mouth.
well, you are not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
well, that is what i mean.
how is that?
i can not tell. you are stomach's in the way.
answer me somethin'. what happened at the copa with salvy when i was out of town?
when?
you know, when you gave him a beatin'.
nothin'. salvy was out of line. he was drunk or somethin', i dunno. anyway, the windup was i gave him a beatin'. tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. it is all forgotten about.
why did not you tell me about it?
it did not have nothin' to do with you.
did not it have nothin' to do with me?
no, i just told you what happened.
who did it have anything to do with... vickie?
jack, no. i just explained the whole thing to you. it was just between me and salvy, if it had anything to do with you and vickie, i woulda told you about it.
well, i heard some things.
whatever you touched, that is good now.
did salvy fuck vickie?
what?
you are supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I am askin'...
i did keep an eye...
then why did you give him a beatin' if he did not do anything? you and him been friends a long time.
some things changed between us. now, he thinks who the fuck he is. he is been passing certain remarks that i do not like.
do not bullshit me, joey. you am not tellin' me the truth.
what bullshit? hey, I am your brother. you wanna believe me -- you trust me?
when it comes to her, i do not trust nobody. I am askin' you somethin'.
well, you are wrong jack. I am tellin" you what happened. he got outta line, we had a fight, and it is straightened out now.
you givin' me that look. i got to accept your word, but if i find out anythin', I am going to kill somebody...
so, go ahead. kill everybody. kill salvy, kill vickie, kill tommy como, kill me while you are at it. what do i care? you are killing yourself the way you are eating, the way you worry about things you do not have to worry about.
what do you mean, "you"?
what?
what do you mean, "you"?
i meant, kill everybody. you or me or anybody. you are a big shot. kill, kill... g'head.
but you said "you."
so what?
eh, joey, even you do not know what you meant. you mentioned salvy, tommy como, you -- that means somethin'. why did you say them? you coulda said anybody.
you are worried about this girl, you are going to let this girl ruin you are life for you... you wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can not bend over -- that you got to step in the ring in a month.
did you ever fuck my wife?
what?
i do not mean now. i mean before -- before we met.
whadda ya mean?
did you ever fuck my wife?

i am answering...
what do i have to do to get a straight answer around here.
jake, no --

i did not do anything wrong. i swear. i just had a few drinks.

nothing is what i said! go on, kill me.  kill me.  I am not afraid of you anymore. i do not care if you kill me like you are killing him. you are a sick animal.
you are the fuckin' animal! you ran around with every guy i knew while i was breakin' my ass for you.
you are not only an animal, you are a stupid animal.  you are rotten.  rotten.  rotten.  you are a sick maniac. a maniac! you belong in a mental hospital.
you know, if there is one thing -- i just do not understand you, not one single little bit. you love me?
yeah --
it am not worth it, jake. get out.
what time is it?
nine o'clock.
at night?
yeah. at night.
how many pounds i gotta lose?
three more, i figure.
just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. just a chip of ice.
I will give you anything you want, jake. i think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
are you outa your mind? if i come out, I will lose the title.
jake, why do not you just try lying down and get some rest.
i do not know what it is. i dunno, it is the kind of thing that -- the words will not come out.
jake --
what?
i want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
ok. talk.
why do not you just call him up?
what do i say to him? call him up on the phone and say, "joey, I am sorry about that little trouble we had. how about havin' dinner?" is that what i say?
no, not that.
then what?
i do not know.
i miss joey. i wish joey was here.
why do not you just call him?
i dunno.
tell him how you feel -- you miss him. tell him you are sorry.
ok, all right. telephone's in the hall. dial his number.
he am not hurting me, but i can not get him down.
do not talk. keep at it. jab, jab, jab. you are ahead on points.
I am pulling out of next wednesday's tv bout 'cause i can not make the weight. I am fighting at light heavyweight, and i still can not make the weight.
does that mean...
it means I am through with boxing. I am tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I am sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
you sound bitter.
why should i be bitter? boxing's been good to me. i got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. vickie.
am not she beautiful? coulda been mrs. america if i did not pull her outa the contest. did not want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
what do you think of jake's retirement, mrs. lamotta?
j.r., glad you could make it.
you were great, jake. just like old times. good thing sugar ray was not here tonight. oh jake, this is state's attorney bronson and his wife.
you are a good sport, lady.
i saw you fight bob satterfield in '46, jake. in chicago. you were great.
yeah, i really cleaned up on him.
where is your wife, jake?
do you think I would let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
I am sorry. i had to work late last night. slept at the club.
I am leaving you jake.
sure, what else is new?
no. this time it is true. i did not bother to tell you until i had everything worked out.
open the door, vickie.
no. i will not talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
aw, c'mon. do not say that.
i got a lawyer, jake. we are getting a divorce. I am getting custody of the kids.
aw, c'mon, vick --
I am sick of it. i can not watch you this way. you are too drunk all the time. there is too many girls. i can't... i do not wanna talk about it. i made up my mind.
let's go, jake, wake up!
huh? whadda ya mean, get up?

i know where you are from. you guys look the same every place.
they wanna talk to you.
about what?
i do not run the joint. they just told me to bring you in.
for what?
vickie, open up. i need to come in.
are you drunk?
no. open the door.
the kids are sleeping.
i promise i just gotta pick up one thing.
all right, just do not make any noise.
what are you doing?
i need ten thousand dollars. my lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
but they do not have a case against you.
are you kiddin'? did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? did you see the papers? "lamotta on vice rap." everybody likes a shot at the champ.
jake, be careful! what are you doing to the belt?!
do not make no difference no more.
