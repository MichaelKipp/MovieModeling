poke him or something. see if he is still alive.
he is all right.
has not moved for twelve hours. go on. have a heart.
you do not know that.

tough work, that.
someone is got to do it.

what do you mean you can't?
can not eat through a canvas bag.
this is a farce, man.
how is it a farce?
i seen your fucking face.
so, what do i look like?
you are the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
am i?
yeah. and the brown eyes.
thank you, handsome.
my pleasure.
how did you know it was her?
i can smell her perfume.
see, if we took the hood off, we would have to shoot you. as it is, you have got a fifty-fifty chance.
thought you liked me, bitch.
it was fun while it lasted.
nice lady.
please, man, I am suffocating in here.
can not we take it off?
made the front page. they will move now, the fuckers.
request permission to take the hood off, tommy.
why would you do that?
the poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
so?
and anyway, he is seen our faces.
you sure?
he described me down to a t. knows what jude looks like.
you are his keeper. if you do not mind him seeing you, i do not mind. but you are the only one he looks at.
thanks.
it is your decision.
leave us, judie.
my pleasure.
now, if you took the ropes off, I would be able to feed myself.
no fucking way.
only joking.
what is that?
five ten. brown eyes. but you are no pinup.
no?
nope. not handsome at all.
you trying to hurt my feelings?
no. it is the truth.
well, i could say the same about you.
could you?
but i won't. we are more polite around these parts.
so I have noticed.
hey --
what is it now?
you are going to have to do it, are not you?
do what?
kill me.
what makes you think that?
they are going to let that guy die. and you are going to kill me.
they will not let him die.
you want to bet?
I am not a gambling man.
and even if he does not die -- you can not just let me loose.
why can not we?
not in your nature.
what do you know about my nature?
I am talking about your people, not you.
what the fuck do you know about my people?
only that you are all tough undeluded motherfuckers. and that it is not in your nature to let me go.
shut the fuck up, would you?
and you know the funny thing?
no, what is the funny thing?
i did not even fancy her.
did not look like that to me...
she is not my type.
c'mere.
no.
ah, c'mere. i want to show you something.
what?
my inside pocket.
she would be anyone's type.
do not you think of it, fucker.
why not?
she is mine. anyway, she would not suit you.
no?
absolutely not.
she your wife?
suppose you could say that.
you make a nice couple.
do not i know it.
so what were you fucking around for, then?
you fuckers set me up. that bitch --
she is a friend of mine
okay. that nice lady. meets me in a bar. I am saying what the fuck am i doing here anyway. she buys me a drink. she holds my hand. I am looking at her saying i do not like you, bitch. but what the fuck. maybe I will get to understand.
what?
what the fuck am i doing here.
what the fuck were you doing here?
i got sent.
you could have said no.
can't. once i signed up.
why did you sign up?
it was a job. so i get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
should not take it personally.
"go back to your banana tree, nigger." no use telling them i came from tottenham.
and you play cricket?.
best game in the world.
ever see hurling?
that game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
best game in the world.
never.
the fastest.
well, in antigua cricket's the black man's game. the kids play it from the age of two. my daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. then we moved to tottenham and it was something different.
how different?
toffs' game there. but not at home.     .
so when you come to shoot me, paddy, remember, you are getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
I will bear that in mind.
nice to meet you, fergus.
my pleasure, jody
take it easy, now. just go slow. down by that tree.
tree.
can't.
well then, you are going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
now, that was worth waiting for.
hurry up, would you?
these things take time, fergus.
now put it back in.
give us a break.
thank you. i had a case of the clap two years ago. crabs in ulster. but all in all it is served me well.
shut up, would you?
I am sorry. did not mean to offend you, fergus.
fergus?
yeah?
thanks. i know that was not easy for you.
what the fuck is this?
it is nothing. he is just got a sense of humor, that is all.
you are on duty. keep your fucking mouth shut. go in and get some sleep.
so he knows your name?
i told him.
are you all there?
back in a minute, jody
you will have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
yes.
and do you know why?
why?
because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that is why.
so what is that supposed to mean?
means what it says. the scorpion does what is in his nature. take off the hood, man.
why?
'cause you are kind. it is in your nature.
see? i was right about you.
do not be so sure.
jody's always right.
where would you most like to be now, man?
does not matter where.
come on, man. if this shit was all over.
having a pint in the rock.
you lack imagination, fergus. think of something more alluring.
like what?
like having a pint in the metro --
having two pints in the rock.
having a pint in the metro, and dil's having a margarita.
who is dil?
my special friend.
oh, yeah.
we got simple tastes, you and me.
the best.
but you fellas never get a break, do you?
do you?
oh, yes. we do a tour of duty and we are finished. but you guys are never finished, are you?
we do not look on it like that.
I have often wondered how you do it.
depends on what you believe in.
what do you believe in?
that you guys should not be here.
it is as simple as that?
yes.
put that thing back on him, fergus.
he is hot.
does not matter if he is hot. just cover the fucker up.
have you no feelings, woman?
you shut your face --
you are heading for trouble, fergus --
he is a good soldier, jude.
i said shut the fuck up --
he believes in the future --
is it bad?
no. not bad. women are trouble, you know that, fergus?
i didn't.
some kinds of women are...
she can not help it.
dil was not trouble. no trouble at all.
you liked her?
present tense, please. love her. whatever she is. I am thinking of her now, fergus. will you think of her too?
do not know her.
want you to do something, fergus.
what?
if they kill me --
do not think that way.
but they will. as sure as night follows day. they have to. i want you to find her out. tell her i was thinking of her.
see if she is all right.
i do not know her.
take her picture. c'mere.
take the whole lot. i will not need it.
i told you not to talk that way --
go to millie's hair salon in spitalfields. take her to the metro for a margarita. do not have to tell her who you are. just tell her jody was thinking --
stop it --
you ok about that?
I am a volunteer, am n't i?
good. i was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
shut up, jude. you best get some sleep tonight, fergus.
peter.
what?
request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
you are crazy. do not let him, peter.
shut the fuck up, jude.
why do you want to do that for?
would make me feel better about it.
you sure about that?
I am sure.
okay. you are a good man, fergus.
don't.
I am sorry.
help me.
how can i?
i do not know. just help me. give me a cigarette.
go to sleep now.
i do not want to sleep. tell me something.
what?
a story.
like the one about the frog?
and the scorpion. no. tell me anything.
when i was a child...
yeah?
i thought as a child. but when i became a man i put away childish things...
what does that mean?
nothing.
tell me something, anything.
not a lot of use, are you, fergus?
me? no, I am not good for much...
take the hood off, fergus --
no.
I am glad you are doing it, do you know that, fergus?
why?
cause you are my friend. and i want you to go to the metro --
stop that talk now --
hurling's a fast game, is not it, fergus?
the fastest.
faster than cricket?
cricket's in the halfpenny place.
so if i ran now, there is no way I would beat you, is there?
you will not run.
but if i did... you would not shoot a brother in the back --
you stupid bastard --
what you say, faster?
i said you bastard -- stop --
got to catch me first --
used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
hurling --
what?
hurling --
fergus!
you are back in the pink, tommy? how're you keeping?
you will notice I have asked you nothing.
that is wise, tommy.
all right, then. i like to be wise.
so what do you need, fergus?
need to go across the water.
do you now.
need to lose myself awhile.
aha.
someone recommend you?
in a way.
who?
guy i work with.
what is his name?
does not the water get to your nails?
what is it to you?
nothing.
you american?
no.
not english.
no.
scottish?
how did you guess?
the accent, i suppose.
and what is it like?
like treacle.
that should make her happy.
who is she?
do not know. who is she?
see that, col?
see what, dil?
he gave me a look.
did he?
just cut his hair, you know.
yeah?
what you think?
nice.
saw that one.
what would you call it?
now, that was a look.
now he can look.... ask him does he like his hair, col.
she wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
tell her I am very happy with it.
he is scottish, col.
scottish?
yeah.
he agreed that he was.
what do you think his name is?
I have no thoughts on the subject.
jimmy.
jimmy?
that is what he said. jimmy.
hi, jimmy.
fuck off, dave.
c'mon, babe! you know what i like... easy!
it is not pat. it is jim.
jim, pat, mick, what the fuck. long as you remember you are not at lords.
so can we consider you a regular, sir?
is that good or bad?
well, you get to say, the usual, col. things like that.
so let's call this the usual.
thanks.
he is still looking, col.
persistent.
good thing in a man.
an excellent quality.
maybe he wants something.
i would expect he does.
ask him.
ask him yourself.
everybody wants something.
not me.
not you. how quaint. how old-fashioned and quaint. is not it, col?
you old-fashioned?
must be.
you fucking promised.
did i?
you fucking did.
it takes all types.
so who is he?
he is what she should run a mile from.
then why does not she?
who knows the secrets of the human heart.
do not be like that --
you heard me --
hi.
hi. you forgot your bag.
thank you.
who the fuck is he?
jimmy.
it is him, is not it?
maybe.
see, they get the wrong idea.
cunt.
what was that?
they all get the wrong idea.
cunt. scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
charming.
he is going to take his foot off slowly, david. then you are to go home, like a good boy. you hear me?
cunt.
you all right?
yes, thank you.
what was that all about?
he wants me to perform for him.
perform?
you know.
you on the game?
god no. I am a hairdresser.
he is getting up.
you can not leave me then, can you?
you want me to ask you in, right?
no, i did not --
but I am not cheap, you know that? loud, but never cheap.
now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
where?
half-five. at millie's.
give me that look again.
what look?
the one you gave me in the metro.
what is that about?
they are jealous.
why?
i wonder.
now's the time you are meant to do something, is not it?
like what?
make a pass or something. is not that the way it goes?
must be.
you got a special friend, jimmy?
how special?
you want one?
jesus christ!
jesus.
that dave?
the things a girl has to put up with.
piss off, dave!
tough guy, huh? are you going to be all right on your own?
I am not on my own, am i?
would you like a drink?
yes, please.
what will it be?
whiskey.
someone out there.
jesus fucking christ.
hey, stirling fucking moss --
it is dave.
sure, dave --
please, dil --
take your clothes.
do not throw my clothes out the window!
fuck off back to essex!
fucking mad!
do not chuck my clothes out!
take your fucking goldfish, too!
sorry. how did he drive with his neck in a brace?
must be in love to manage that.
does not know the meaning of the word.
he lived here with you?
tried to. sit down, will you?
he was different.
how different?
as different as it is possible to be.
tell me about him.
no.
should not i go?
yes.
no --
did you do that to him?
you want to know how i kissed him?
yes...
are you jealous of him?
maybe.
that is good...
what would he think?
can not think. he is dead. in ireland. he was a soldier. went there like a fool.
do you miss him?
what do you think?
i think you do.
you say that like a gentleman.
do i?
like you are concerned.
but you can t stay, you know that?
did not think i could.
a real gentleman...
should not you be in mourning?
i am.
look, I am sorry.
fuck off, dave.
no, i will not fucking fuck off. said I am sorry, did not i?
yeah. i heard. you hear, jimmy?
did he come here too?
is this an obsession of yours?
maybe.
he did sometimes.
did he dance with you?
so what do you want with me, jimmy?
want to look after you.
what does that mean?
something i heard someone say once.
you mean that?
yeah.
why?
if i told you, you would not believe me.
drink.
what is this?
I am superstitious. drink.
can not leave me now.
aha.
the thing is, can you go the distance?
depends what it is.
no, depends on nothing.
what you thinking of, hon?
I am thinking of your man.
why?
I am wondering why you keep his things.
told you, I am superstitious.
did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
all the time.
even now.
no...
he looks after me. he is a gentleman too.
he is back, col
hi.
do not want any of those looks, col. they do not mean much.
stop it, dil --
no. tell him to go fuck himself.
she wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
I am sorry.
tell him to stop messing dil around --
dil --
tell him it hurt --
i have to talk to her, col --
come on, dil --
where?
how much did that frame cost, mr. franknum?
two hundred quid, mr. deveroux.
your pat just cost me two hundred quid.
sorry will not bring the bloody thing back, will it, mr. franknum?
not in my experience.
off his wages.
do you mean that?
he wants to know do i mean that.
I am sure you do, mr. deveroux.
bloody right i do...
is that his tart? does pat have a tart?
she is not a tart.
no, of course not, she is a lady.
she is not that either.
never let the sun go down on an argument, jody used to say.
what you doing here?
got your note. so let's kiss and make up, hon.
do not call me that.
sorry, darling.
give it over, dil --
apologies, my sweet.
you are something else, dil, you know that?
never said a truer word.
see, i was always best looking after someone. must be something in the genes.
must be.
and the fact that you did not know is basically the fault of yours truly. and even when you were throwing up, i could tell you cared.
you could?
do you care, jimmy?
sure i do.
you mean that?
yeah. i care, dil.
do it on your own time, paddy.
what?
whatever it is she does for you.
if i was her I would consider that an insult.
consider it how you like. just get that bloody tart out of here.
what is that supposed to mean?
it is a simple question.
my, oh my, jimmy, how gallant.
shut up.
made me feel all funny inside.
i said stop it.
ask me to meet you again, jimmy.
you think that is wise?
nothing's wise.
i did not mean to hit you.
i know that.
kind of liked you as a girl.
that is a start.
so I am sorry.
make it up to me, then.
how?
ask to meet me again.
will you meet me again?
when?
whenever. tonight.
do they know?
know what, honey?
know what i did not know. and do not call me that.
can not help it, jimmy. a girl has her feelings.
thing is, dil, you are not a girl.
details, baby, details.
so they do know.
all right, they do.
don't.
sorry.
i should have known, should not i?
probably.
kind of wish i didn't.
you can always pretend.
that is true.... your soldier knew, did not he?
absolutely.
will not be quite the same though, will it?
are you pretending yet?
I am working on it.
there is dave. he knew too.
stop it, jimmy.
am i becoming repetitious?
a little.
sorry.
do not ask me in.
please, jimmy.
no. can not pretend that much.
i miss you, jimmy.
should have stayed a girl.
do not be cruel.
okay. be a good girl and go inside.
only if you kiss me.
happy now?
delirious.
what was it, fergus? did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
leave me alone, jude.
no. that is the last thing I will do. you never asked what happened.
i heard.
eddie and tinker died.
i know.
maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. no thanks to you.... what you think of the hair?
suits you.
we had a court-martial in your absence. they wanted to put a bullet in your head. i pleaded for clemency. said we should find out what happened first. so what did happen?
he ran. i could not shoot him in the back. i tried to catch him. he made it to the road and got hit by a saracen.
so you did fuck up.
yes.
but you know what the thing is, fergus?
no, what is the thing?
you vanished quite effectively. became mister nobody. and you have no idea how useful that could be.
what do you mean?
we have got some plans here. and we will need a mister nobody to execute them.
no way, jude. I am out.
you are never out, fergus.
leave her out of this.
jesus, fergus, you are a walking cliche. you know we will not leave her out of this. but I am glad to see you care.
she is nobody. she likes me.
so i suppose a fuck is out of the question. keep your head down, fergus. no sudden moves. and not a whisper to her. you will be hearing from us.
lucky you.
carnations.
what?
he would bring me carnations.
so i got it wrong, then.
not at all, honey.
don't.
okay.
come on.
why, honey --
come on.
you gonna tell me why?
no.
what is wrong, jimmy? tell me what is wrong --
not here.
what was it?
you know her, jimmy?
jimmy, is it? do you know me, jimmy?
dil, this is jude.
you following me?
yeah. just checking. he being nice to you, dil?
ever so nice. are not you, jimmy?
that is good. I am glad. young love, as they say.
absolutely. the younger the better. does not come your way much, i suppose.
do not go looking for it, dil.
well, maybe you will get lucky. someday.
a bit heavy on the powder, is not she, jimmy?
a girl has to have a bit of glamour.
absolutely. long as she can keep it. is not that right, james...
it is her, is not it?
what is her?
she is the thing you had to tell me.
kind of.
I am sorry, you know that? I am really sorry.
you see that, col?
saw it, dil.
fuck it, is what i say.
yeah. fuck it, dil.
fucking men, col --
you could always make it up to her.
how?
when a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
she is not a girl, col --
whatever you say.
so it was you all the time.
who would you think it was?
i thought it was dave.
and who is dave when he is at home?
he is at home.
should blow you away, you know that?
i know that.
I am getting emotional. and i do not want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, hennessy?
i understand.
fuck you, too --
leave him alone, peter. he is in love.
that true, fergus? you in love?
and what is she like between the sheets?
definitely unusual.
and who is she?
just a girl.
and you know what will happen if you fuck up again, do not you?
aye, i do, peter.
good.
so what do you think that is, hennessy?
a hotel?
it is a knocking-shop. tres discreet, huh? he visits his ladies on tuesday and thursday nights and saturday mornings. his security's in the car beyond.
who is he?
does not matter who he is. he is what we would call a legitimate target.
thank god for that.
you being cynical, hennessy?
hope not.
good. so what do you think?
whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. and i presume you can not get in.
right.
so it is on the street.
right.
kind of suicide, is not it?
but, then, i do not have a choice.
och, you do, fergie.
of course. i forgot.
come on, fergie. a rehearsal.
and then you will leave her out of it?
aye. then we will leave her be.
and what if i say no?
you know what. go.
you were made for this.
was i?
perfect.
and what happens then?
we will be on the other side. we will move when you do.
and what if you don't?
fergus, i think you do not trust me.
you may be right.
stay late at your work tomorrow night and I will bring you the gear.
jude?
yes?
who is the old geezer?
some judge...
should not be, dil
why should not i be jealous?
she own you, jimmy?
yes.
she from scotland too?
you could say that.
and you are not going to tell me more?
i can't.
what you doing, jimmy?
I am not sure.
do you like me even a little bit?
more than that.
you do something for me, dil?
anything.
you would do anything for me?
afraid so.
you got the keys to the shop?
you want another haircut, baby?
no. sit down.
you said anything, dil
a girl has to draw the line somewhere --
want to change you to a man, dil...
why?
it is a secret.
you would like me better that way, jimmy?
yes.
and you would not leave me?
no.
you promise?
i promise.
you are no good at this, jimmy.
I am sorry.
you want to make me look like him...
no. want to make you into something new. that nobody recognizes...
so it is true, then?
what?
you like me better like this.
yes.
do not call me that --
sorry. what you doing?
why?
for me.
for you...
why are we going here, jimmy?
look on it like a honeymoon.
you a handyman, fergie?
i take pride in my work.
i sincerely hope so.
dil! dil! what the fuck are you doing here?
I am going home!
told you to stay in the hotel!
thought you was fooling me. thought you was leaving me.
i had to go to work!
stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. there is something you are not telling me, jimmy.
come on...
no! I am going home...
so tell me.
i was trying to get out of something.
no! tell me everything, jimmy.
you got to forget you ever saw me, dil.
you mean that?
yes.
you heard what i said, dil?
my pills...
what pills?
prescription. for my condition.
what condition?
are you supposed to take that many?
only in times of extreme stress.
are you all right, dil?
i will be.
good-bye, dil
jimmy?
what?
do not go like that.
dil can i tell you something? i knew your man.
you knew which man?
your soldier.
you knew my jody?
lifted him from a carnival in belfast. held him hostage for three days.
you knew my jody?
are you listening?
yes.
i got the order to shoot him. before i could do it he ran. ran into a tank and died.
died...
did you hear me?
you killed my jody?
in a manner of speaking.
it was you...
you killed my jody
no.
you didn't.
i suppose i tried.
you tried.
do not you want to kill me?
do not leave me tonight. might kill me, too.
okay.
wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
he asked me to see were you all right.
see, i fix on anyone that is nice to me. just the littlest bit nice and I am yours.
stop it, dil --
just do not kick dil and she will be touched. be nice to her and she will be yours forever.
see, i should blow you away, jimmy. but i can not do that. yet.
let me go, dil
why?
got to be somewhere.
try and go, then.
let me go for fuck's sake, dil -- or they will be here
let them come then.
that fucker's dead --
no, we are.
give me the shooter, jude --
you are crazy --
give me the fucking shooter!
you like me now, jimmy?
i like you, dil --
give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
more what?
more endearments.
i like you, dil
love me.
yes.
tell me you love me.
whatever you say, dil.
then say it.
love you, dil.
you do?
yeah.
what would you do for me?
anything.
say it again.
I would do anything for you, dil.
