yeah, i know, fatso.  do us all a favor.  make top dollar smile.
mom --?
i told you you are not supposed to come in here.
i lost my key.
hey, darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
out.  now.  i gotta work.
having fun yet?  no?  I will give you a hint.  remember whatshername?
shelly?
miss her?
yes.
kill the men who killed you both, and the day of the dead will be your reunion.
get it?
leave me alone -- !
little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  this dick trying to bushwack me.
murderer.
a year ago.  halloween.  a man and a woman.  in a loft.  you helped to murder them.
last halloween, eh?  yeah...  yeah, i remember.  i fucked her too, i think.
you cut her.  you raped her.  you watched!
hey, i got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
i want you to tell me a story, tin-tin.
i do not know you...
holy shit... you are dead, man...
victims.  are not we all.
glad to see you are finally with the program.
bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I am busy.
you work for the dead.  forget that, and you can forget it all.
sure it coulda.  funboy's not here, neither is t-bird -- none of top dollar's number ones.
you know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that is guilty of zip on paper.  top dollar runs showtime; what is the matter, do not you like adult entertainment?
this sack of shit is called tin- tin.
do not any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
he was a runner for top dollar. just muscle.
was. albrecht  this is not top dollar's style anyway.  this was somebody else. somebody new.
and you are going to tell me who.
who ever made that.
what in the hell... do you call that?
i call it blood, detective.  if you want, you can call it graffiti.
cute nickname, do not you think?
i am not got no fuckin' ring.
wrong answer.
top dollar.
another jolly nickname?
you want those assholes, you want top dollar.
t-bird?
like the car.  he hangs out with skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the pit -- hell, funboy lives there.  ask top dollar.
a whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
and i say I am dead... and i move.
no further.  I am serious.
are you nuts, walking into a gun?
you must listen carefully:  the fire department will be here soon. there is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  as shelly webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
listen:  top dollar.  he "owns the street here."  he will "erase my ass."
you do not say.
i know top dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
fucking a, my friend.
the others are called skank, t- bird.  street names.  funboy.  watch me, office albrecht.
you look like a rock star without a job.
i dabble.  may i?
an unexpected pleasure.
bad news.  alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  tin- tin got himself whacked.
who got himself what?
one of mine.  and it was not a standard hit.
i had heard something like this.  describe it for me.  the "hit".
i was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
i know of no one.  but even if there is, i am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I will rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
to be sure.  now tell how your friend died.
whatever it is, the answer's no, eddie.  I am too busy tonight.
annie, i need a file.
speak up.  clear it with the captain if you need a file.
this is special, darlin'.  please?
just do not tell me you "owe me one."  what file?
double homicide.  a year ago. las halloween.
my mom works over there.  I am waiting for her, but she is probably with him, right now.
who?
mister funboy.
mister funboy lives there?
he has a room, upstairs.  i do not like him very much.
i can pick out a tune now and again.
can you play "teddy bears' picnic?"  it used to be her favorite.
does she have a name?
no name.  you sure ask a lot of questions.
do you feel okay.
no.
you gotta go now, i bet.
i have to go.
do not thank me.  your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
i knew that.
could be.
you going to wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
well, hello there...chocolate,
do not thank me.
thanks, babe.
oh wow, oh wow, do not fucking do that, man.  i nearly had a fucking heart attack.
fun -- look at that guy...
it is just the dope, do not worry
fun, he is not going away; he is scaring the piss outta me!
not me.
how the hell did you do that?
magic.
neither.
yeah, i got a more fun idea myself.
owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  aaaaaa!  goddd!
does it hurt?
does it hurt?!  you dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  what the shit are you gonna do about this?!
no, wait, no wait, that is too much, man, that is like overkill, nobody can take that much, you are wasting it -- !
your pain ends now.
getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, are not we?
go away.
you need to learn to mind your own business or you will never get where you think you are going.
shut up.
maybe i was wrong about you.
you, my friend, are dead.  i saw your body.  you got buried.
i saw it, too.
you died, man.  i can not believe it but here you are.  last year, you and your girlfriend --
i need you to tell me what you remember.  what happened to us?
you went out the window.  she was beaten and raped.  she died in the hospital.
you okay, man?  i mean, what just happened.
the venom of bad memories.  you were there; you saw her.  i saw you seeing her.
my name.
I am sorry as hell, man.
thirty hours.  a day of life, plus change...
halloween is coming, soon.  you will have top dollar if you watch for me at the showtime, tomorrow night.
i should be trying to stop you.
thank you.  for giving a damn.
my pleasure. eric do not smoke these.
did you see an animal of any kind? did you see a bird?
no.  i saw a guitar.  this is not some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  there was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  in blood.
chili dog for breakfast... it is original.
mom tried to cook.
oh.
i know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
i do not know you.
I would like to get in touch with him.
you are not a cop, either.  what do you want him for?
I am looking for a good guitar man.
right.
you buying?  he kinda wanders around.  you will see him if you pay attention.
i need to find him kind of soon, elly.
sounds like our "crow" is out-maneuvering you.
"our" crow...?
come now.  you have seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. what about your turf, top?  you do not seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
the night is young.
do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  when i was a boy in saigon i watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  whole lives erased.  a way of life, polluted.  today, no one forces me to move.  i use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
nice speech.  what is it supposed to mean?
your comprehension is not required.  your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
top dollar, you are the only one here still wasting good air...
five large, in the drawer right over there.  i never saw you.
do you know what you destroyed?
take the dope, too.
a year ago.  a very nice lady circulated a petition.  she died. last halloween.  answer yes or no.
that is ancient history.
it is yesterday!  do you know what you destroyed?
who gives a fuck!  I am a businessman.  you going to do me, then do me and shut you are face!
you do not even remember...
i never forget anything, dickhead. that building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  it got a little rowdy... end of story.
rowdy.  let me fill in some gaps for you.
it is done. albrecht i figured as much.  did you cap off funboy.
funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
yeah, among others.  hey, man -- you are hit.
it is only a flesh wound.
it is only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
i mean, I have done what i came to do.  it should not hurt this much. but it will pass...
right.  you sure i can not just take you to the emergency ward?
they could not do anything for me.
how 'bout the morgue?
no.  i have one more thing to do.
what... the hell is that?
this is a cobra, mr. grange.  yes, it is real.
that thing is poisonous.
extremely so.  you and i are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling the crow.
give me a break.  that guy's a wacko...
i intend no slight to you, but i cannot find the english to adequately express just what he is.  i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury.
not a plymouth fury, i bet.
do you know of spirit assassins? you do know the dead can rise? properly motivated, of course.
like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
mmm.  but tonight i can take what is his.
only thing you will get from that clown is a faster way to die. lao to the contrary...
who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  when he begins to care about the living, you will find his heart can bleed... and i want it to bleed for me.
kill a dead guy?
what is going on...?
a remembrance.  a closure.
you brought flowers.  as long as you do not forget her, elly, she lives.
she is dead.  she is gone.  and now you are just going to go away and never come back, too.  i hate this place; it is not fair.
elly...
i remember him!  here, gabriel... here kitty... gabriel... is he still yours?
i think he is yours, now.
shelly would have wanted you to have it.  this way, you will think of her every time you see it...
and she will be alive.  up here.
i was wonderin' where you would gotten to --  oh, elly, honey, a cat.  here?
he was a present.  besides, we are moving anyway.  you said.
we will discuss this later. obviously.  you left the door open.
your job is done.  you interfere with the living again.
tell me I will get hurt.  that i might die.  I have already done that.  i do not need anyone's help.  yours included.
do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  the blood will not return.  no powers.  no reunion.  nothing.
fine with me.
you will be alone.
I am already alone.
we have got company.
is he inside?
do not waste my time.
very well, it is your ass.
i believe our friend elly call you mister crow.  please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
i can see her.
of course you can. angle - grange in the gallery --  in darkness.  the running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which throws vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I have got him if you want him.
no shooting.
move in, guys.
i wish to possess what you have now.
i want the girl.  unharmed.  now.
i know.  that is why i will prevail.  mr. grange... ?
sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine fury.  and it turned out to be you. at last.  i appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. that is why i desire them.
you are too late.  there was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  but he turned to dust and blew away.  i do not have any power for you to take.
i do not believe that. lao motions to grange with the killing blade.  grange relaxes his deathgrip on the crow.  move in close on eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
you sorta looked like you might need my help.
this is not your place.  this is not your fight.  and i do not need your help.
you are welcome.
leave here.  do not do this.  i do not want you here.
the hell you say.  this is not just about you any more.
do not interfere.
you are bleeding, man.  you can not make it.
and how many lives have you destroyed?
i took yours from you.  your little girlfriend?  i took hers, too.  your meaningless, petty life?  i took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  you are no avenger. you are mine.
now do you get to see her? shelly, i mean.
in a better place.  i hope.
you are not going to come back, are you?
i do not know if i can.  but you have this... and you know where to come.
you mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  euww.
at least it finally stopped raining.
it can not rain all the time.
