you feel it?
yeah.
sammy thinks the caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
two men... two guns in the caddy.
the boys found this on the floor in back of the caddy.
yeah, they showed me
could be unrelated.
could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
no. could be someone's missin' maybe.
that's what i'm thinkin'.
why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
i just wanted to come here.
to denny's? i wasn't going to say anything, but why denny's?
this denny's.
okay. why this denny's?
it's kind of embarrassing but,
go ahead.
i had a dream about this place.
oh boy.
you see what i mean...
okay, so you had a dream about this place. tell me.
well ... it's the second one i've had, but they were both the same......they start out that i'm in here but it's not day or night. it's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but i'm scared like i can't tell ya. of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. you're in both dreams and you're scared. i get even more frightened when i see how afraid you are and then i realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. he's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. i can see him through the wall. i can see his face and i hope i never see that face ever outside a dream.
so, you came to see if he's out there?
to get rid of this god-awful feeling.
right then.
i guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. nice man... farmer i hear.
yes, he is. he raises corn.
damn lot of corn raised in hollywood these days too.
well, i ...
you don't have to tell me. it's written all over that pretty face of yours.. you came here to be an actress. i just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
i...
you probably don't remember her, but louise bonner lives right over there in number 29. when she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
have many famous actors and actresses lived here? i was meaning to ask you that.
honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
i guess i've come to quite a place.
sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
no, i don't.
that's good. they're allowed, but i don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. one man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. you wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
i can hardly wait, coco.
it's unbelievable!
i told ya.
wow!
now i guess you and your aunt have an understanding. so here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. if you want, later i'll introduce you around. no hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. it's just up the stairs we passed. it's open to all the tenants. you can see the hollywood sign from there.
oh coco thank you. thank you so much.
you got it! see you later honey.
that's okay.
i'm ruth's niece. my name's betty. i'm sure she told you i was coming.
there was an accident. i came here.
i understand. i saw the dress. i...i'm sorry.   are you all right?
a car ... a car accident.
are you okay?
i think so. i was just taking a shower.
oh my god. i'm sorry. i'll let you get back to that. i'm going to get unpacked.
my name is rita.
hi...do you work with my aunt?
no ..........i.
i...i mean......i...it's none of my business.
she has pretty red hair... she is very kind i think.
she sure is. she's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in canada, but i guess you know that.  i couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. unless of course i'm discovered and become a movie star. of course, i'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, i guess you'd say, sort of why i came here. i'm sorry, i'm just so excited to be here..i mean i just came here from iowa and now i'm in this dream place. you can imagine how i feel.
i think i've been hurt.
oh...
no.
but, this could be serious.
no...i need to sleep.
if you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
it will be okay if i sleep. i need to lie down and sleep.
all right, but...i'm going to check on you.
so man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
unreal ... so, you're looking good. whatcha doin' these days?
well, not much ed. just doin' some stuff for this guy.
making ends meet, huh.
hardly.
yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
oh, things aren't so bad. gee, i hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
it was just a thing. the story made you laugh.
yeah, that's a funny story.
so what's the problem?
there is no problem.
so why did you idiots bring me here? ... i'm in the middle of making a picture.
we'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
interest?! there's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
you'd better fix this, ray!!!
i'll speak to someone.
and you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! this smells like a set-up to me!  and by the way, ray, i don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film i've shot is in a vault at the lab that only i can access. no one's getting that film!!
what is it rita?
i'm...i'm... oh no... i thought when i woke up... i thought sleep would do it ...
what's wrong?
i don't know who i am.
what do you mean? you're rita.
i'm not. i don't know what my name is. i don't know who i am!!
yeah, sure. look what happened to them.
no, no, no, i told you. they're fine. they're all real happy.
my next delivery is up that way, so i'll be getting down to it real soon.
you're so easy.
gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
yeah, what for?
keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
what's  the matter now?
nothing... i don't like being out in the open like this.
it must be just so pathetic being you. sure billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
not here...no thanks.
not a coke or anything?
no ... thanks though... i'll take a cigarette if you have one.
sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
no.  i haven't seen any.
a brunette? ... maybe beat up?
no...
you'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
sure.
well...  what do you think about then? i mean...  well what do you think about?
what do you mean?
well ... if you don't remember anything, i mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
nothing. i do remember the car crash... i told you... i remember the glass ... i think about that sometimes ... i remember walking here, sort of. now i remember this place and you. that's about it.
how do you remember how to talk?
i don't know.
you don't remember anything else?
no  there is something...something there i can't tell... i can't describe it.  there are things there.... but i'm... here.
the money. you don't know where it came from?
unh, unh.
when you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
adam, where are you?
what's going on, cynthia?
they've closed the set. they sent everybody home.
what did you say?
they fired everyone.
who fired everyone?
ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. you'd better get down here adam!
no.
you've got to talk to ray you've got to fix this.
i'm going home.
home! meet me at the office. we've got to do something ... you've got to do something adam!
i'm going home cynthia.
adam, this isn't like you. please come to the office. there must be something we can do.
i'm going home. i'll call you later.
mulholland drive.
mulholland drive?
that's where i was going... mulholland drive.
maybe that's where the accident was. there must be a police report. we could call.
no.... i don't...
we could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
okay... but just...just to see.
just to see if there was an accident on mulholland drive.
okay.
come on... let's find you something to wear.
hi. i'm inquiring ...well, i heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and i want to know if there was an accident on mulholland drive.
yes, there was.
can you tell me what happened?
no. i can't.
was anyone hurt?
may i have your name please?
there's nothing?
not that i can see.
no. just the coffee.
we'll take our check.
strange to be calling yourself.
maybe it's not me.
call the number.
it's not my voice ... but i know her.
maybe the voice isn't diane selwyn. maybe that's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are.
maybe...maybe ... maybe.
what's wrong with that?
i'm not sure about this.
i know you're afraid of something. we'll be careful. tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
yes...what is it?
i'm sorry mr. kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
... what??
the fact is mr. kesher a representative of your bank called us.
how...  how'd they know i was here?
i don't know. all we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
so, what did they say?
well, sir, i'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
unbelievable. look... here.  i don't know what's going on. that's so much baloney. i've got enough cash for one night, okay?
that's fine, mr. kesher. you can pay cash when you check out. i'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
fine. i'll check out in the morning.
have a good evening, mr. kesher.
someone's shut off my money!
i know.  where are you adam?
what do you mean "you know"?
someone called me. when they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. i didn't believe then, so i made some calls.
and?
you're broke!
but i'm not broke.
i know, but you're broke. where are you?
beverly hills hotel. i've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
do you know somebody called the the cowboy?
the cowboy??
yeah, the cowboy. this guy, the cowboy, wants to see you. jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
oh, jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the cowboy. should i wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, adam, and i think you should do it and i think you should do it right away.
cynthia...what's going on?
it's been a very strange day.
and getting stranger. where do i meet this cowboy? i mean do i have to ride out to the range?
sort of, funny boy. if i tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of beachwood canyon. there's a corral up there where he'll be.
you gotta be kidding?
will you meet with him?
yeah, sure. it is that kind of a day. when?
i'll call him, then call you back...if you want you could stay at my place.
cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
i'm just offering a place to stay.
i understand, cynthia and thank you for the offer. i'll find a place. now go ahead and give the cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
git along little dowgie and call me back.
howdy!
howdy to you.
beautiful night.
yeah.
sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that beverly hills hotel.
no problem. what's on your mind?
well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
whatever.
a man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. is that somethin' you agree with?
sure.
now... did you answer cause you thought that's what i wanted to hear or did you think about what i said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
i agree with what you said...truly.
what did i say?
that a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
so since you agree i guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
how's that?
well, just stop for a little second and think about it. will ya do that for me?
okay, i'm thinking.
no. you're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. now i want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. can ya do that for me?
look ... where's this going? what do you want me to do?
there's sometimes a buggy. how many drivers does a buggy have?
one.
so let's just say i'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
okay.
now i know a few things. i know you have had a rough day. you're probably thinkin' i don't know the half of it, but in actual fact i know every part of it. the business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
it will work out.
good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. you understand that?
i understand.
you're an understandin' fella.
so, this is the last time i see you then unless i do bad?
no, this one doesn't count. it's part of the original one. so then ... until we meet again.
okay.
"you're still here?"
"i came back. i thought that's what you wanted."
"really?"
"my parents are right upstairs! they think you've left..."
"so... surprise"...
"i can call them... i can call my dad... "
"but you won't..."
"you're playing a dangerous game here. if you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"you know what i want...it's not that difficult."
"get out! get out before i call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. this will be the end of everything... "
"what about you? what will your dad think about you?"
"stop! just stop! that's what you said from the beginning. if i tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
"before what?"
"before i kill you."
"then they'd put you in jail."
oh, no wonder i'm starving. i'm going to fix a sandwich. you want one?
i'm all right.
you've got to eat something. you're just nervous about going over to see if you're diane selwyn.
your aunt called me.
i was afraid of that.
she wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
it's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. i tried to explain that to aunt ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. i kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any ritas ...
sweetie, look at me straight.
coco...she's very nice. we went to school together.
so i guess your grandpa and grandma know her.
not really. i met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
you're really something coco...thank you.
don't make me out to be a sucker. louise bonner says there's trouble in there. you remember last night. sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
is everything all right? is it bad for you that i'm here?
everything is a-okay, but i've gotta get that sandwich!
nice wallets.
handstitched italian. filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the caddy.
the one of 'em still alive?
yeah... just .... dr. scott's got 'im. you remember dr.scott.
oh yeah.
well he said...  you know in his way... you know what i mean? besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. so, dr. scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. he's laughin' you know and shakin'... son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... it was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. you know how he is.
find out who they are?
nope, not yet. their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
interesting.
yeah ... and they both use the same address.
where at?
palmdale.
damn, that's a long drive.
i hope i'm back in a couple of hours. don't drink all the coke.
good luck!
when i get back i'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
okay.
sorry to trouble you, coco.
it's all right gorgeous. something wrong?
no, no. i'm on my way to my audition. before i go i wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... aunt ruthie's friend who helped put this together. it completely went out of my mind.
his name's wally brown .... great guy. been in the business since forever.
thanks coco. it'd be so embarrassing
naw! he wouldn't have cared. just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and i've got a feeling you'll do just that.
thanks coco. i'll let you know.
get going. you don't want to be late.
right. see ya.
good luck, honey!
to my audition.
and who are we auditioning for today?
wally brown.
and do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings wally brown is in?
no, we don't.
well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
yes, sir.
mr.wallace brown is in the executive building on the second floor. we want to go in and turn right at the first street. then we want to walk three blocks down past stage 17 to the white executive building. once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. now do we have name?
betty elms.
let's see if we have a pass for betty elms ... and we do. here we go. and good luck miss. elms.
thank you... thank you very much.
betty elms?
yes.
i'm wally brown. your aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
very pleased to meet you.
come in. i'd like you to meet everyone.
hi.
well. shall we get to it? would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
no, no, i'm fine.
well then, take a seat everyone. betty why don't you join jimmy and we'll play the scene. is there anything you'd like to say bob... something to betty before they begin?
just tell me where it hurts, baby.
what?
i want to play this one close, bob. like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. that felt good. whaddya think?
betty.
yeah ... betty. you don't rush it. i don't rush it. we play it close, just like in the movies.
you're still here?
i came back. i thought that's what you wanted.
i can call them... i can call my dad.
but you won't.
stop... just stop! that's what you said from the beginning. if i tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
before what?
why didn't you ask him? sol knows you!
but i don't know, sol. i never heard of sol. i'd just get in trouble. that's why we shouldn't go see about diane selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
you're not going to get in trouble. you're going to find out who you are. finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
don't stop!
what is it? what do you see?!
those men in front, in the car.
do you know them?!
no... but...
keep going. go around to the back.
yes?
diane?
number 17.
but it said #12.
i switched apartments with her. she's in #17. just walk down that way. it's just to the right.
well ... we'll leave her a note.
i'll go with you. she's still got some of my stuff.
i don't think...
c'mon help me in. i'll open the front door.
no.
rita... i know what you're doing.
what ... i..have... to do.
i know what you have to do, but let me do it.
rita... i want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
but i want to.
no. we shouldn't touch that money. we don't know about that money. that might be dangerous money. you have to start all over again. you look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
it sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
hey, let's introduce the brand new you to hollywood. we haven't seen the roof garden yet.
