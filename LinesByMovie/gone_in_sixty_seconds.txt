i know you --
you know my back -
you want to come along quiet?
how's atley -- ?
leg's all banged-up. he made a stupid play ... he'll limp around the yard up at folsom. but astricky will be there to take care of him. with their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
let them go --
how's that?
let them go. and i'll leave ...
you'll leave -- ?
you don't have anything on me. a misdee auto-theft. i got no record. i'll be out in three days, and back at it. or you let them go, and i give you my word. i'm gone. and without the ringleader ... your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
i don't golf...
you have my word...
get out of here, then. now.
you know what you got here?
not really -
there's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... you know what you gotta do -- ?
not really --
you have any other answers besides "not really"?
not --
right. you want to test the voltage drop ... use the voltmeter ... remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... see what you got ... you understand -- ?
uh ... randall -- ?
excuse me --
the corner of hawthorne and granvia. tumbler messed up. he said the lotus would be at the corner of hawthorne and granvia --
he didn't mess up. there it is ...
how are we supposed to--
pop the trunk. i need my tool ...
thirteen down ... thirty-seven to go ...
no problem -
how's the leg?
only hurts when i breathe. lookit you. where are barney fife and aunt bea hanging out? and opie ... where's opie at?
what are you doing here?
is there someplace we can talk?
what about?
about your brother. and the deeeep shit he's in --
it's been a long time, memphis --
six years ...
six years. shit. time flies, don't it? six years ago we were fartin' through armani and pissin' cristal. now look at us ...
tell me about kip -
he took a job. and he fumbled it. now he's jammed-up. jammed-up bad...
what kind of job... ?
a boost. a big boost ...
a boost? what's kip doing on a boost?
it seems she neglected to mention it
maybe she don't know. although i don't see how that could be. maybe she didn't want to upset you -
don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, atley...
the point is: kip's been living the life. only he's a wild child. crazy. makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. but he fungold this one so bad, folks around l.b. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
who was the job for?
who do you think?
you look good...
you, too, ma...
what are you doing back?
how's kip?
have you seen him?
no.
oh.
atley jackson came to see me ...
atley jackson. how is that one? how's the leg... ?
why didn't you tell me?
i couldn't. i didn't want you to worry. i thought held sort himself out. i hardly see him. he comes and goes. he's in trouble, isn't he?
he's in some trouble ...
i knew it. he's changed, randall. he's a different boy. he's lost that... that sweetness ... it's gone ... and i don't know what to do ...
you getting my checks ... ?
of course ...
he doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. i don't know what you remember of him. but you should brace yourself
hey, kip, what's up?
what do you say, toby?,
i'm cool -
what do you want, shithead?
why you gotta front me like that? i'm talking to kip --
why don't you leave him alone?
i known kip longing than you, man ...
oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
any word, kip -- ?
no ... and they won't take my calls ...
what does that mean -- ?
it ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
hey, kip ...
hello, memphis --
it's good to see ya, man. you changed your look -
you, too
hey, memphis. remember me? toby walker. i live next door ...
sure. hey, toby. you grew up
yeah, i'm cool ...
that can't be it. cos we don't need saving
we don't -- ?
he give you an advance -- ?
hell, yeah. ten larger man
but don't worry, man. things are all sweetness and light here...
things are all leafy and suburban ...
randall raines ... it's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though i do i recall you as a man with style. you remember your old friend, atley -- ?
how ya doing?
it's about my brother ... kip...
yes ... kip ...
car-jacker. neglected to clean up after himself ...
jesus ...
the business has changed...
now. where were we? oh, yes. kip.
i don't want him hurt...
my point. yes. simple, really. i require the best. i insist on the best. i only engage the best.  your brother. his friends. they came to me. they wanted my paper. he was your brother. you were the best. now. they've brought so much goddamn heat down, i may not be able to fill this order. which would be very bad for me. which in turn, is very bad for them...
i could kill you. that occurred to me. when i first heard about this. that i would kill you ...
grow up. you don't kill people like me. people like me die in their sleep at 87 ... do you know why? because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over california ...
i can come up with the front money. pay you back...
were it only that easy. i have obligations. the order needs to be filled...
they gave you only four days?
they gave me two weeks. i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
i'm not interested --
i knew you'd say that.
i'm just here about my brother.
i knew you'd say that, too --
sound it out for me.
your brother has four days. fifty cars. five-zero. for that he gets 200 large ...
and if he doesn't make it -- ?
i don't want them hurt. any of 'em...
"don't want" the dodgers to lose or the summer to end. but we don't get to choose these things...
i know you.
you know my back.
when'd you get to town, raines?
the other day....
what for?
no particular reason. catch a laker game. i heard we got shaquille ...
where you been, anyway?
just out there. roaming around. building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
you seem a little hinked-up ...
not at all ...
i remember us having made some kind of deal, randall. i don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. i look at you - here - in my town - and i'm confused...
a little family emergency --
i hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
no...
or your baby brother. what was his name?
kip.
yes, kip. short for kipling. named for the english writer of stories about india ... he bites into his pear ... memphis says nothing, waits ...
and this has what to do with me?
i don't know. but you shouldn't be here. take care of your business. i'll give you 24 hours. and then i don't want to see your face. ever again. make a fool of me once, that's my bad. make a fool of me twice. that's really my bad, and i'll kick your ass from here to india ...
good. cos you know how it plays. six years ago, i let you go free. but the next time ... the next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
by the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. we'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
you goin' home?
yeah... you want a ride...
sure -
how'd you get here? your moms give you ride -- ?
hell, no. i boosted a 'vette.
you boosted a 'vette? then where is it?
i dunno. it was right here. someone musta' boosted it back...
damn crooks is everywhere --
kip -- ?
yeah ...
you all right -- ?
i think so. there's things i can't feel right now. like my feet. but ... you think you can get me outta this, memphis? i'd appreciate it -
just hold-on there --
this has nothing to do with any of that --
oh. you maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
all my enemies own car crushers. it's like a pre-requisite ... owwww...
easy ... take it easy ... we're almost there...
you okay -- ?
totally. i'm fine. you want a beer, man -- ?
sure --
you sure you're okay -- ?
yeah, man. where is your beer?
cool. so you're living up north?
yeah -
i heard you were pumping gas -
something like that -
you're kind of cultivating a new look.
yeah --
nah. it's a scratch.
okay --
hey, you want something to eat ?
what do you got ... ?
there's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
yeah, yeah. that's what i'm thinking --
so what are you gonna do?
about what?
"about what?"
about calitri? no worries, man. i'll call him. he's a reasonable dude ...
i can see that -
what happened to you?
what?
you just got crushed in a car. you're bleeding all over your self. and you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
c'mon, man... my "demise..."  overreaction
"over--"  you know - i can maybe understand, since i been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that i can partly blame myself. but what is baffling to me, is how, since i been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
hey, now -
he's gonna kill you -- !
i can handle it --
you can handle it?
i can handle it --
you can handle it?
i can handle it --
you?
me.
you?
me...
you don't think so, huh?
not really ... but you know... maybe i'm wrong ...
what's with the fish thing -- ?
we can learn something from our asian friends. they smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
fish.
and they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. you know why? all they eat is seafood.
also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "karaoke."
i do a poaching number. six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. in 8 minutes, i could cater a goddamn wedding. plain but flavorful. and it's a good way to show off my hollandaise sauce ...
you have a hollandaise sauce ?
i do ...  christ, what happened to us ?
speak for yourself, boss i don't have a hollandaise sauce
no, but you dress like an asshole ...
i think about that night a lot...
me, too. every time i walk...
how they were just there ... waiting on us ... the fix was definitely in ...
yeah -- ?
yeah tell him to lay off kip and them tell him it's on
am i dying? are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  and have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
hello, otto ...
you remember junie?
of course. hi, junie --
whatever do you mean?
the chop-shop... where are the stripped cars?  the rolled-back odometers? the part bins?
what happened? old-age happened. i tired of killing them. i woke up one morning and thought i am no longer a destroyer. i am a means of resurrection. now. we restore. we revive. there are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. most must die. these don't have to...
i heard rumors you were back. about kip ...
he's gotten involved --
you think it can be done?
are you considering a comeback tour?
tell me...
it can be done. take two days to shop; one to prep. i'll offer up my bible for a small fee. you also have to hope kip's jerk-circus didn't undo castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. and then get yourself a crew...
the hard part ...
"a people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - yes, and then to get around them..." nietzsche said that.
is he still working here ?
the old crew. go find them. i can't help you with that. since i've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... a pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
i just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
i remember i had a 1964 buick opal. worst car ever built. value job. everything broke and i-fixed it. a coma car - built to german specs. plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. on a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. but when that car was gone, i missed it. if it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
and the moral of that story is -- ?
go to them. they'll be happy to see you ... ahhh...
damn. memphis raines. long time ...
how you doing, man?
all i get are the orientals. they can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em so? what are you doing here? what's with the outfit -- ?
you know where the others are?
forget that ...
okay. figure it forgotten. what's this about anyways -- ?
most of 'em are late-model...
that's right. only 10 exotics ...
we'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
some crew you got ...
if we put out the word. that we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... what do you think that'll yield?
a bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. this ain't like the old days, memphis. the profession has lost its..
dignity...
yeah...
wow! they got eleanor here -- ?
i know. weird, huh -- ?
lookit kip. all grown up...
hey, donny --
what are you doing here?
otto called -
you need him...
no we don't -
i appreciate your dilemma, memphis. but how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
his criminal career has officially come to a close ...
the conundrum still applies, of course. the purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. however. this cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
we do this. then. you're finished. then. you're clean
i like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all clifford huxtable on my shit ...
you hear me?
i hear ya. get me outta this. i'll move to the country. open a fruit stand...
you guys have any skills at all?
hell, yeah. mirror man here is our electronics expert. he's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
how old are you now, toby?
sixteen. but my birthday's in seven months ...
what about him?
freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
okay, then... otto?
in order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. put all your nuts in one basket. and...
you spread it out ... you move around... so's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... shadow games and shit ...
"shadow games?"
shadow games ...
you spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. know something's up. with a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
we're on a truncated time-table. take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... and we're still going to need to expand the crew...
there's no one left ...
we've got several italian cars on the list. always tricky, always timeconsuming. so we're gonna need a specialist ...
you know of one -- ?
yeah. he's knows of one all right.
see you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
what are you doing here?
what's with the look?
the hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
you look like you lost your sheep ...
you still wrenching at bacchiochi's?
hell, yeah. i'm not getting rich in here ...
buy you a drink?
nope. i got a coffee. and a boyfriend.
"mitch?"
mitch.
so i was replaced by mitch?
no. you were replaced by alex. who was replaced by kevin. who was replaced by vince. who was replaced by mitch...
on account of mitch?
on account of me.
i've taken the spear for a lot of people, sway. including you. can't we improvise a little here ... ?
no can do. life goes on, pointfive ... you left me, remember?
i left town. i didn't leave you.
a distinction worth noting ...
and here i am...
yes. but i got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
kip's in trouble
what kind of trouble -- ?
kip took a job. fifty ladies in two weeks. only the two weeks have turned into four days. and not a single lady has been snared.
and you got some italians -- ?
six or seven...
i'm not doing it anymore. haven't for a while. i've carved out something for myself. it's pathetic, but it's mine ...
i understand -
what the hell are you doing -- ?
if you change your mind. we're at otto's. it's 50 ladies in 24 hours. for the carpenter. 200 k and kip's life on the felt. so long now ...
how'd it go?
keys were in it ...
well, that defies the point, don't it?
take it back, freb --
hey, now, memphis... c'mon, man -
who is it -- ?
castlebeck.
jesus. the whole damn thing's loaded.
one minute -- !
i know you.
you know my back.
what are you still doing here, randall?
stopped by to see otto. say hello.
what's this -- ?
cadillac.
what's wrong with it -- ?
needs brightening ...
no faith in our new-found goodness, detective ...?
sure. but sometimes we got to create some numbers. the task force is run by statistics, you know ...
you're thinking: okay, there's no want ... but they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
something like that -
okay, then. i'll catch you later, randall ...
double-meaning intended, right?
right ...
it's funny. there's probably been five more cars stolen in the time i've been here ...
i don't think so, detective ...
the photo album. i get nostalgic around this time of year ...
what time of year?
tuesdays ...
you ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
every day. i wonder about that every day...
kip and i'd probably be working at the dealership...  imagine us selling cars?
and just in case you lose your keys, good sir, i can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
mother -- !
i remember. supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
you remember that, kip?
i know...
we do it. he'll get clear once and for all
this eleanor's been living at the international towers for 3 years now.
who's "eleanor?"
the 167 mustang shelby mustang gt-500.
why do you call it "eleanor?"
all the vehicles get code names. female names. you say "eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
eleanor is memphis' "unicorn."
and there she is --
it looks just like a regular mustang --
don't go there, toby --
she's not. carroll shelby tweaked the mustang's high-performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... but its actual output is closer to 600 ...
so she flies -
she soars -
i logged outside the g.r.a.b. site, right? then i monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? then i got these isdn numbers, right? then i tracked them back, right? then i took the one i could jack-up the easiest, right? then i called back see, they think i'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like i'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? so now they're sharing it with me, right? they think i'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. so they let me in, right? give me all these numbers. but then i don't leave, right? i'm in. i've got the key. now i just go anywhere i want.
so what's in there -- ?
i can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. i can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. i can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "friends" and "seinfeld"...
it just ain't happening --
you'll get the hang of it, kid. you just need to remember one thing -
what's that?
i guess ...
you got a school teacher or nancy from accounting, you don't put on sly stone or james brown. you put on ravel. rachmaninoff. but if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on cat stevens or james taylor. you'd put on prince. or isaac hayes. or, if you really wanted to get after it: miles.
okay ...
it's the same way with cars. different cars. different tunes. you can't steal a maserati listening to sinatra. you gotta get urgent. you gotta get sonny rollins or led zeppelin iv, on that shit. but never, never-ever take no allman brothers into a lincoln town car. could lead to disaster. got it... ?
got it ...
good.
that's mirror man ... and that's freb ... and tumbler ... and toby ... fellas, this is sara wayland... they call her "sway."
hey -
okay. we're all here. today's wednesday. d-day is friday night ... that gives us two days to prep ... we're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... let's get into the vans --
where we going -- ?
we're going shopping -- !
how's it going -- ?
it's arright ...
yes, i do, in fact. john wayne in mco...
that's being obscurest ... who else? better known. memphis?
jim rockford. rockford files.
for real?
for real. okay. gimme columbo...
peugot convertible ...
what color?
gray.
how you know that?
remember who my brother is?
okay, okay. what about magnum p.i.?
thanks for playing, freb. that's a gimme ...
no. that was higgins ....
jonathan quayle higgins ...
anyone? the significance of "robin 1" on magnum's license plate? memphis?
robin was robin masters. he owned the estate they lived on ...
ten points for our fearless leader ... sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the bill bixby trifecta -- ?
walked like a bastard... skippin' stones and shit..
that's a good one, donny...
i think so too --
hey.
what's wrong with her -- ?
the right side of the engine is running richer than the left. and the scope isn't showing shit... i dunno...
right. great car. one of a kind. i was looking forward to that boost myself
she was the only "annie" you could find?
they only made a handful. we're lucky there's even one living in the area...
yeah, well ... she lives with district court judge seymour croft ...
she's trouble --
i put the boys on it. they're clever that way...
i go with you --
that what you want?
that's what i want ...
okay.
you mentioned that in your letters
i always thought you'd follow me up.
we were good when you bailed, weren't we?
very good...
cos there were those dark days, when i figured - my god, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... and give me up in the process.
no way ...
no ... ?
no ...
don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, randall. i'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. so save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. the only reason i ride with you, is cause i don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
oh. okay. right.
i'm on the move -
your girl works in there ...
not my girl anymore
yet your still here ... i gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
what do you want from me?
honestly? i want to - once every few months - get into my car. pack a lunch. and drive on up to chino. on visiting day. bring you some magazines. maybe some almond clusters. and see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. that's what i want ...
reads the infrared. then kills it. little something the r & d department came up with ...
how long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
after a while, it became a little pathetic ... figured i'd put you out of your misery ...
thank-you ...
de nada ...
ain't we good-timing here ... ?
the family that steals together, deals together...
dad'd be proud --
maybe not. but dad was from another era...
what era was that -- ?
the era when crime didn't pay --
as opposed to now, kid car crusher?
price of doing business...
what about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
it's for assholes. the legal buck blows, memphis.  you know that. doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
what about me?
you'll be at the docks ... keeping otto abreast of our progress ...
how come ... ?
because you should be home with nintendo, listening to the spice girls, little man ...
come on. kip, talk to the guy
this is how you're spending my time? having a sock hop?
everyone know ray calitri? pillar of the community ...
look at this. a multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
get out of here, ray --
one more night --
get out --
i hope you know what you're doing. god help you if you don't ...
d.w.p. thanks for holding. how can i help you?
i got a message. i live at 1443 locklin.
yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
no! no, i can't! i'm a busy man.
okay, sir. let me just get the-order. yes. we'll be doing some work out your way. we've got a power leak. and it's unsafe. we're moving residences to the... marriott long beach ... just for the night ...
oh, for god's sake
i know, sir ...
breakfast brunch -- ?
yes, sir -
okay, then ... i just go to the marriott and i'm set ...
you've been pre-booked...
i miss orville redenbacher already --
okay, okay. the important thing to remember, is to think slow. take your time. it may not seem like it, but the night is long. long enough. just think slow and think smart...
okay. all our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. let's keep chilly. think slow. any questions?
you sure i can't go with ya?
ready -- ?
oh, yeah.
no whistles, but a club you bring a hack -- ?
no. open her ...
what the hell's that -- ?
a little trick i picked up at the car thief retirement home ...
diane 1.
very good. think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
yeah.
that's an after-market alarm. can't just cut her wires ...
gosh, no. lipstick? what next? mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
deodorant.
so, you seeing anybody?
no. i had a girl. she was great. the problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. so i gotta wait another three years before i can even bother to look...
she was so great, why'd you leave her?
her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
what's the matter?
it's all microchips and shit ...
yeah?
having fun, kip?
hell, yeah... it's a beautiful business ...  i mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
how's it going?
it's going fine. the quiet riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
c'mon, gang. let's focus. sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
i think so... they're just... so ...
i know. but let's prep 'em. we could stay here all night... that wouldn't be good --
so? tell me: how come they call you "freb" anyways -- ?
c'mon, man ...
we're partners here --
you okay -- ?
i'm cool.
too early to tell. nervous?
nah.
that's strange. i'm nervous. donny's nervous. everyone's nervous. but not you...
i dunno. whatever will be will be...
that's a good attitude, kip. for everything but stealing cars ...
arright ... enough ... i can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. but he puts his mouth to her ears ...
shhh... car thieves are your weakness.
stop. what about maserati boy?
i take out my slim-jim...
oh, god...
slip it in ...
you're going high-cheese, dude --
unlock your button ...
"unlock my button" ... ?
the alarms go off ...
woo-woo-wooooo!
i pop your hood; find your siren wires
they're factory alarms ... easy to get around... for a man with... skills...
i do ... i cut "em...
cut 'em...
now... i'm in ...
of course you are. you're a professional...
i ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
i bet you say that to all the girls...
with a twist of my wrist ... you're turned over ...
wrong preposition...
hear you roar ...
what about the club ... ?

you want me to buy her?
shocking, huh? we're clear now. it's done. i've never actually paid for a car. i want to see what it feels like
dinosaurs. all of us. the ice age is now...
i'll see you soon --
where you off to -- ?

i can't. i got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and i haven't slept and--  where to -- ?
i dunno. i know a place.
this time it's for real?
oh, yeah. for real, point-five.
what -- ?
nothing. just that if i was less secure, i might think you were more into eleanor than you are me...
she does have one thing you don't.
what's that?
bench seats.
