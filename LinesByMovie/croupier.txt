three years, two months. march '93.
what a memory you have got. maths always was your strong suit. what happened to the moaning lisa?
she went back to south africa.
did she?  you were pretty thick at one time.
we all played the field.
hi-ya... I will call you back.  now then...
i want a job, giles.
all right. as what?
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader. you employ readers, do not you?
we do. for unsolicited manuscripts. we pay twenty pounds a manuscript. you might get two, maybe three in a week. can you live on sixty pounds?
great.
found a job?
no.
well I have got something for you. in london, i mean. I have been chatting to some friends. do you know the golden lion casino? it is in bayswater, i believe... they are looking for a dealer, a croupier.
do not be stubborn. the pay will not be grand, but it is regular. that is what you need, is not it? i know you do not like taking my advice...
it is not that.
I have set this up for you. call the golden lion and ask for mr reynolds, he is the manager. i do not know him personally, but I have spoken to his boss. do not say no, jacko. give yourself a break.
for christ's sake, jacko, do not look a gift horse in the mouth. have you written that name down? reynolds, at the golden lion.
all right, dad. yes, I will call him.
so how are you doing, dad?
great. I have just started a new company. solid financing. it is good.  i love you jacko, you know that
yes, i know that.
do not let yourself down.
i won't.  goodbye, dad.
david reynolds, I am the manager here. sit down, john.
jack.
you have been recommended by the management here. they know your father. he has a bit of a reputation, has not he?
has he?
in any case, i understand you have had some previous experience... in south africa.  you will find the rules a little different here. before we start, you have not got a police record, have you?
no.
where did you go to school?
i was at beadles.
i do not think i know that one. private, i suppose.
there are three types of casino in the u.k. high volume. small faction. and motr. that is middle of the road. us.
do you have a salon prive?
we tried. but there was not enough business. the punters like company.
i have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
we check every four days.
why four? and not three or five?
it is the procedure here. now sort the chips.
stacks of 20. rows of 5.
any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
give me 365.
you use two alternating, do not you?
we do.
where is the magnet?
they have been tested.
have not you forgotten something?
i do not think so.
wipe your hands.
not with your own cloth. besides, your pockets will be stitched.
what happens if i want to sneeze?
you won't. not without permission.
how many aces are left?
five.
i make it six.
five.
what makes you so sure?
it is a rule. always stand by your first count. the odds are you are right.
good call.
you want me to check?
i said good call.
let me just run through a few things. as a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. we will need your picture.
what for?
for the database. it can be accessed by every casino in the country. we have the same system for punters.
i do not gamble.
ever?
i do not gamble, mr reynolds.
next point. friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
we had the same rule at sun city, but it was impossible to check.
this is not south africa. we would know, because someone would report it. believe me, someone always does.
does know? or does report? what would happen if i knew something like that and did not report it?
we would know. there are no secrets in this casino. you would be punished.
how?
first offence: verbal warning. second offence: written warning. that one's filed and sometimes copied to the gaming board. my discretion. third offence: you are sacked on the spot. you would never work in a casino in this country again.  there is another rule: you are forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. if you see someone who is gambled here, even if it is just casually on the street, you must ignore him. or her. you are not married, are you?
girlfriend?
yes.
she is not in the gaming business is she?
no.
this is our crow's nest. I am showing it to you now, but you will never see it again.
very impressive.
we have tapes in here that go back six months. let me show you something.
you can start monday week.
fine.
that hair will have to go.
fine.
i just want the job.
jack, you are not the usual type we get here.
what kind of deal you looking to?
what is the blue book price?
that is not relevant. an old car like this, it depends on the condition.
how about fifteen hundred?
how about five hundred.
what?!
how about we split the diff... seven-fifty.
is that your idea of arithmetic?
I am not a mathematician. I am in business.
eight-fifty.
seven-fifty.
i could not resist them.
you mean i will not resist them.
no, no. I am not ready for you. there is some vodka in the freezer.
you want me drunk?
i will not be that long.
you really are a beautiful woman.
it is not just inner beauty, is it?
turn around.
where did you get it?
i. sold the car.
you should not have done that. i know what it meant to you.
i owe you for the rent. it is only a car. i can get another.
take it back. till you sell your book.
come on, marion. let's face the truth. nobody's going to publish it.
of course they will. you just have to be patient. I am betting on you.
you are my prisoner.
I have got something to tell you.
i want to hear it.
I have got a job.
what job?
in a casino. as a croupier. a dealer.
how did you land that?
it came my way. 450 a week.
450? what did you do, just walked in and said i want to be a croupier? do not you need training?
i had training. in the republic.
you were a croupier there? you never told me that. i thought you just knew some gamblers.
i start monday week.
you sold the car. you got a job. what is the third thing? tell me.
there is no third thing. do not be superstitious.
i love you jack, you know that.
are you trying to read my palm?
you have got such beautiful hands.
I am bella.
jack manfred.
hi, jack.  welcome to the cesspit.
is it that bad?
how do i look?
why do not you take a break, jack.
all right, mr reynolds.
mr tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with bella.
does he win?
he is a good customer.
where do you live, jack?
over the river.
have you got transport?
I am going over the river. I will give you a lift if you like.
thanks.
so how do you feel, your first night? I will bet you are on a high.
nice car.
she is my baby.
how long have you worked at the casino?
coming up to two years now.  but i was away for six months.
you have done pretty well.
not bad. i have other interests, of course.
I am off to a little watering hole. why do not you join me? relax.
no thanks, matt. i need my eight hours.
I will lay you five to one you will not sleep. in this job you have to unwind. otherwise it will kill you. i mean that.
some other time.
what is the time?
i do not know.
how did it go?
fine.
you are shaking. what is it?
tension. it will go.
poor baby.  this'll relax you.
i loved it blond.
it is only hair. i have not changed.
when you get home, I am asleep. when i leave home, you are asleep.
I will see you in my dreams.
I am sorry, sir, that is a late bet.
what are you talking about? it is 11, I have won. with this lady.
you have won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
i put them on together.
I am afraid that is not so, sir.
I am sorry, madam, we do not accept gratuities in the uk. it is different in south africa.
you know where I am from?
I have lived there.
well, thank you anyway.
look matt, there is something i have to say to you. i saw you cheating.
what the fuck are you talking about?
that greek guy who won at the end. you paid him out in 25s not 20s.
i do not cheat, jack. you have got it wrong.
I am not going to report it.
what are you, a cop?
if i see you do it again, I will report it.
i do not get you. even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
because if a supervisor knew I would seen you and i had not reported it, I would lose my job as well. and i can not afford that.
so it is mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing but legal theft. and that is ok. it is the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they have not earned it. we earn our money.  I am on your side, jack. i do not need an enemy.
you are talking about complicity.
i do not know what that means. I am talking about not rocking the boat.
who are these guys?
mostly people in the casino business. a few drug dealers.
and the girls?
just girls. what are you drinking?
vodka. straight. on the rocks.
good call. help yourself.
does bella come here?
that bitch? no.
hey jack, join us.
no thanks.
do not worry, i will not report you!
i do not gamble.
I am off. i need to sleep.
loosen up, jack. if you don't, this job'll get to you. the pressure's too much, believe me, it will break you.
"the world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." ernest hemingway.
where have you been? I have got to give evidence in court at nine.
do not play the cop with me, marion.
take that back!  fucking take that back. I am not a cop any more.
i take it back. you are not a cop any more. you are a store detective.
are you drunk?
probably.
this fucking job's getting to you. you have not written a fucking word since you started.
do you have to swear all the time?
well, that is my poor upbringing. i did not go to no private school. i have not got no class. i want to live with a writer. not a fucking croupier. i do not even know what the word means. croupier.
marion, stop this.
what do i mean to you? i want to know. tell me.
you are my conscience.
have not you got a conscience of your own?
what are you doing here?  you know the rules.
what about a drink on the way home?
i do not finish till eight. make it nine and you are on.
I am on at nine.
well, that is our life now, is not it?
oh hello.
you know what? I would like to buy you a drink.
it is against the rules. dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
that is stupid. what are the odds of you being seen with me?
impossible to calculate.
to coincidence.
there is a casino in this hotel.
I am not much of a gambler really. i just like this bar.
so why did you come to my casino?
i was at a loose end. a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
first visit to london?
no, no. i come every couple of years. i always think I am going to stay. I am from cape town originally
i was born in the transkei, on the wild coast.
near the casino.
in the casino.
now there is a coincidence. my father used to gamble there.
your father?
i loved the atmosphere. but it destroyed my poor mother.
the debts.
and the lies. gamblers are born liars.
and superstitious too. it is like witchcraft.
that is africa. there is an african in all of us, is not there?
we all came from africa, supposedly.
do you believe in astrology?
absolutely not. but then, I am a gemini and geminis do not believe in astrology.
I am not married. i wear it to keep the flies off.  i must go. let me pay for this.
absolutely not.
toss you for it.
i do not gamble.
i can not give you a lift back tonight.
do not worry.
jack. do you need a ride?
no. thanks.
my car's in the garage.
maybe another time.
I will take you up on that.
goodnight.
you do not recognise me? you had me barred. you fucking little worm.
wait a minute. you got yourself barred.
it was you, you shit.
you are shaking.
it is the tension.
i hate cheats.
all men are cheats.
but do not worry, I am clean as a whistle. i only did s & m.  no blow jobs. no screwing.
why did you quit?
i got scared.
i can imagine.
can you? I am happy being a dealer. at least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
you called the casino a cesspit.
well it is. but i know where i am.
I have been watching you work. you are the best in the place. but you know that.
i despise the job.
ah, we all say that. but if we hate it, why do we do it?
the indian rope-trick.
look, now I am pumping you. I am sorry. it is none of my business. it is just that you are not like the others.
not like matt, you mean.
now he is a real shit. do not get friendly with him. I am sure he is got his hand in the till. you know what he said to me once? "i want to fuck the whole world over. that is my mission." the shit!
ouch.
sorry.
rough day?
rough life, jack.
what happened to bella?
I will tell you later.
i do not like it.
why not?
i do not like it at all. you had a wonderful character before, the gambler. he was so romantic.
he was a loser. this guy's a croupier. he can not lose. people have shat on him all his life. now he is in control. he is a winner.
is that your idea of a winner? he does not give a shit about anyone. he uses people and --
-- it is because of the sex, is not it? you do not like the sex in it.
i do not give a fuck about the sex. most men'll fuck a lamppost. he is just a miserable zombie. is that the way you feel now? is that what is happened to you?
marion. it is a book.
oh really. then why is he called jake. why do not you come clean and call him jack.  there is no hope in it.
it is the truth.
without hope there is no point to anything.
now wait a minute. what is so hopeful about your job? spending the day catching poor people stealing. you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. at least in the casino everybody gets caught. rich or poor, the odds are the same. it is all relative.
crap. it is not relative. it is unfair. like your casino. it is designed unfair. and your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
the door, jack.
leave it.
no. answer it!
you fucking little shit! you shopped me.
what are you talking about?
reynolds got a doctor in. they forced me to take a dope test. it was positive. as you knew.
i do not know anything about it.
your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. what do you think of that? i can not get a job now.  you bastard. you are no different from matt. a pair of vicious little shits, that is what you are.
look bella, i do not know anything about this. you should talk to matt.
you are all scumbags.
he is paying out in stacks of 25.
i can see.
thanks for the information.
a pleasure. pity about bella.
she was a real asset. but what could i do?
i thought it was you. it is the hair!
I am working on that soccer story.
right.  look, i must get back to habib.
habib?
my author. he is a terrorist. he is written a kill-and-tell book.  take care.
jack, look, next weekend I am having a house party. here...  it is near oxford. why do not you come? it will just be social. no business.  bring a friend. I have plenty of room.
I will try and make it.
looking forward!
how did you hurt your hand?
just an accident. nothing.
turn left ahead.
jani, there is something i want to say. before we get there. i do not know what the sleeping arrangements are. giles probably expects us to share a room.
that is fine.
she is a dab hand with a racquet, your friend.
south african women are very sporty.
i found her in bed with someone.
who was he?
she.
i do not gamble.
do not be a spoilsport. it is only a few quid.
it is nothing to do with money. i do not gamble.
he does not gamble.
I will watch.
last hand.
hey. I have got an idea. why do not we...
i get it.
get what?  are you accusing me of cheating?
good god, no. but with skill like that, what do you want a job for? you do not need to work.
what happened?
remember the guy who cheated at the table?
you do not like cheats, do you.
which side do you like?
you choose.
that trick tonight, i do not think I have ever seen that before.
it can only work with amateurs, a pro would have spotted it.
i didn't.
then you are not a pro.
I am in trouble.
what kind of trouble?
i owe a lot of money.
was that why you did the two grand? i could not help you.
i know that. but you can now.
i do not have any money.  switches on the light. jani is looking distressed.
some people i know, they are planning to rob the golden lion.
they mean it.
who is they?
my creditors. one night, around three in the morning, they will come into the casino -
forget it, jani. it will never work.
the point is, they want a man inside.
and i thought you were a bright woman.
just listen. you do not have to do anything criminal.
robbery's not criminal?
you do not have to be criminal. a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. you will see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. there'll be chaos. and that is when it will happen.
you are serious.
you will not be committing a crime. the man will cheat, you will just be doing your job, that is all.
and i thought you were only after my body.
I have come to know you. you are honest.  i trust you.
what will you do when it all goes wrong?
it won't.
but if it does.
you keep the ten thousand pounds.
what ten thousand pounds?
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. they want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. that is the point. not all dealers are honest. mr reynolds will never suspect you.
reynolds? you have done your research.
next time it will be my neck.
what about my neck?
i want to go back to cape town, i want to start again, clean.
i can not do it, jani.
I am asking you, as a...friend. you would be saving the life of a friend.
i want you to forget what i said.
wait a minute...
no, forget it. the bet's off.
how much do you owe?
let it go.
did they tell you to sleep with me?
i told you, all bets are off.
I am sorry.
what for?
i have to take the car.
good night?
not particularly.
and your lady?
she had to leave early. she asked me to thank you.
a bit unexpected, was not it?
not entirely.
how is that football story corning along?
you said it was going to be social, giles. no business.
it is beautiful. thank you.
i hope it brings you luck.
it will.
that girl, she works at the casino --
-- i do not care about her. of course, i was angry. but not with you. the book is yours not mine. i was wrong, what i said about it. i hurt you, did not i?
you are entitled to your opinion.
it is none of my business what you write. and your job, that is none of my business either. i love you. and I have done everything wrong.
I will leave the casino soon.  i promise.
you will?
within a month. believe me, I am going to quit!
what?
you were talking in your sleep.
not talking. writing.
is it yes?
yes.
thank you.
it does not seem fair. you are offering me ten grand in cash but you can not afford a decent place.
well, life's not fair. we know that.
it is all relative.  i need the money too.
do you?
yes.
the date's not set yet. I will call you. one last thing: the man you are going to catch cheating, he may get violent. but you know how to deal with cheats.
that bruise has cleared up nicely.
bruise?  oh, yes. it is better.
I have still got mine.
and your hand too.
i took the bandage off yesterday.
would you like a drink?
no thank you.
i do not think we should meet again.
it is a shame there are not more men in the world like you.
are not you ever tempted to gamble?
never. why do you ask?
i can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
gambling's not about money.
really?
gambling's about not facing reality. ignoring the odds.
how did you know i was here?
i thought you would not want to spend christmas day alone in here.
i do not want a criminal for a boyfriend.
there was a message, was not there?
it is probably easier for you to eat the rice.
marion!  what did you tell the police?
nothing about you.
then what?
give up being a croupier, jack. or I will shop you. all you have to do is keep your word. it is that simple.
here...use a spoon.
leave me alone, marion.
you are already alone.
why did you take the money?
i hate public transport.
what?
i want to buy a car.
how can anyone be that naive?
how do you feel, jack?
bruised.
take your time. two weeks. three if you need it. we will pay you sick leave. i do not want to lose you. you are a good man. here...
detective inspector ross.
who...
ross.
who did it? tell me!
of course i recognised him!
you did?
i know a cheat when i see one. the man was a cheat.
what? you know what happened to me, do not you? that bitch bella shopped me. I would like to beat the shit out of her.
I would like to buy you a drink.
cheers. happy new year. i really like you, jacko, you are so fucking straight.  hey, you have not changed your clothes!
you have been avoiding me.
have i?
I am lucy.
and what do you do, lucy?
I am a witch. a white witch. why do not we move on?
are you going to put a spell on me?
i might.
nice car. how much did you pay for it?
too much. eighteen hundred.
where to?
turn left at the lights.
hello...
jack! it is jani.
jani! where are you?
sun city. I have been meaning to call you for months.
how are you?
great. I am getting married. at least, i think i am.
did you solve your problems?
yes. I am all over that now. jack, hold on a minute. there is someone here who wants to talk to you...
what are you laughing at? who was that on the phone?
a couple i know are getting married.
