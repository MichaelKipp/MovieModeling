three years, two months. march '93.
what a memory you've got. maths always was your strong suit. what happened to the moaning lisa?
she went back to south africa.
did she?  you were pretty thick at one time.
we all played the field.
hi-ya... i'll call you back.  now then...
i want a job, giles.
all right. as what?
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader. you employ readers, don't you?
we do. for unsolicited manuscripts. we pay twenty pounds a manuscript. you might get two, maybe three in a week. can you live on sixty pounds?
great.
found a job?
no.
well i've got something for you. in london, i mean. i've been chatting to some friends. do you know the golden lion casino? it's in bayswater, i believe... they're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
don't be stubborn. the pay won't be grand, but it's regular. that's what you need, isn't it? i know you don't like taking my advice...
it's not that.
i've set this up for you. call the golden lion and ask for mr reynolds, he's the manager. i don't know him personally, but i've spoken to his boss. don't say no, jacko. give yourself a break.
for christ's sake, jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. have you written that name down? reynolds, at the golden lion.
all right, dad. yes, i'll call him.
so how are you doing, dad?
great. i've just started a new company. solid financing. it's good.  i love you jacko, you know that
yes, i know that.
don't let yourself down.
i won't.  goodbye, dad.
david reynolds, i'm the manager here. sit down, john.
jack.
you've been recommended by the management here. they know your father. he has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
has he?
in any case, i understand you've had some previous experience... in south africa.  you'll find the rules a little different here. before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
no.
where did you go to school?
i was at beadles.
i don't think i know that one. private, i suppose.
there are three types of casino in the u.k. high volume. small faction. and motr. that's middle of the road. us.
do you have a salon prive?
we tried. but there wasn't enough business. the punters like company.
i have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
we check every four days.
why four? and not three or five?
it's the procedure here. now sort the chips.
stacks of 20. rows of 5.
any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
give me 365.
you use two alternating, don't you?
we do.
where's the magnet?
they've been tested.
haven't you forgotten something?
i don't think so.
wipe your hands.
not with your own cloth. besides, your pockets will be stitched.
what happens if i want to sneeze?
you won't. not without permission.
how many aces are left?
five.
i make it six.
five.
what makes you so sure?
it's a rule. always stand by your first count. the odds are you're right.
good call.
you want me to check?
i said good call.
let me just run through a few things. as a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. we'll need your picture.
what for?
for the database. it can be accessed by every casino in the country. we have the same system for punters.
i don't gamble.
ever?
i don't gamble, mr reynolds.
next point. friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
we had the same rule at sun city, but it was impossible to check.
this isn't south africa. we'd know, because someone would report it. believe me, someone always does.
does know? or does report? what would happen if i knew something like that and didn't report it?
we'd know. there are no secrets in this casino. you'd be punished.
how?
first offence: verbal warning. second offence: written warning. that one's filed and sometimes copied to the gaming board. my discretion. third offence: you're sacked on the spot. you'd never work in a casino in this country again.  there's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. if you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. or her. you're not married, are you?
girlfriend?
yes.
she's not in the gaming business is she?
no.
this is our crow's nest. i'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
very impressive.
we have tapes in here that go back six months. let me show you something.
you can start monday week.
fine.
that hair will have to go.
fine.
i just want the job.
jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
what kind of deal you looking to?
what's the blue book price?
that's not relevant. an old car like this, it depends on the condition.
how about fifteen hundred?
how about five hundred.
what?!
how about we split the diff... seven-fifty.
is that your idea of arithmetic?
i'm not a mathematician. i'm in business.
eight-fifty.
seven-fifty.
i couldn't resist them.
you mean i won't resist them.
no, no. i'm not ready for you. there's some vodka in the freezer.
you want me drunk?
i won't be that long.
you really are a beautiful woman.
it's not just inner beauty, is it?
turn around.
where did you get it?
i. sold the car.
you shouldn't have done that. i know what it meant to you.
i owe you for the rent. it's only a car. i can get another.
take it back. till you sell your book.
come on, marion. let's face the truth. nobody's going to publish it.
of course they will. you just have to be patient. i'm betting on you.
you're my prisoner.
i've got something to tell you.
i want to hear it.
i've got a job.
what job?
in a casino. as a croupier. a dealer.
how did you land that?
it came my way. 450 a week.
450? what did you do, just walked in and said i want to be a croupier? don't you need training?
i had training. in the republic.
you were a croupier there? you never told me that. i thought you just knew some gamblers.
i start monday week.
you sold the car. you got a job. what's the third thing? tell me.
there's no third thing. don't be superstitious.
i love you jack, you know that.
are you trying to read my palm?
you've got such beautiful hands.
i'm bella.
jack manfred.
hi, jack.  welcome to the cesspit.
is it that bad?
how do i look?
why don't you take a break, jack.
all right, mr reynolds.
mr tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with bella.
does he win?
he's a good customer.
where do you live, jack?
over the river.
have you got transport?
i'm going over the river. i'll give you a lift if you like.
thanks.
so how do you feel, your first night? i'll bet you're on a high.
nice car.
she's my baby.
how long have you worked at the casino?
coming up to two years now.  but i was away for six months.
you've done pretty well.
not bad. i have other interests, of course.
i'm off to a little watering hole. why don't you join me? relax.
no thanks, matt. i need my eight hours.
i'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. in this job you have to unwind. otherwise it'll kill you. i mean that.
some other time.
what's the time?
i don't know.
how did it go?
fine.
you're shaking. what is it?
tension. it'll go.
poor baby.  this'll relax you.
i loved it blond.
it's only hair. i haven't changed.
when you get home, i'm asleep. when i leave home, you're asleep.
i'll see you in my dreams.
i'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
what are you talking about? it's 11, i've won. with this lady.
you've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
i put them on together.
i'm afraid that's not so, sir.
i'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the uk. it's different in south africa.
you know where i'm from?
i've lived there.
well, thank you anyway.
look matt, there's something i have to say to you. i saw you cheating.
what the fuck are you talking about?
that greek guy who won at the end. you paid him out in 25s not 20s.
i don't cheat, jack. you've got it wrong.
i'm not going to report it.
what are you, a cop?
if i see you do it again, i'll report it.
i don't get you. even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
because if a supervisor knew i'd seen you and i hadn't reported it, i'd lose my job as well. and i can't afford that.
so it's mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing but legal theft. and that's ok. it's the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. we earn our money.  i'm on your side, jack. i don't need an enemy.
you're talking about complicity.
i don't know what that means. i'm talking about not rocking the boat.
who are these guys?
mostly people in the casino business. a few drug dealers.
and the girls?
just girls. what are you drinking?
vodka. straight. on the rocks.
good call. help yourself.
does bella come here?
that bitch? no.
hey jack, join us.
no thanks.
don't worry, i won't report you!
i don't gamble.
i'm off. i need to sleep.
loosen up, jack. if you don't, this job'll get to you. the pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
"the world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." ernest hemingway.
where've you been? i've got to give evidence in court at nine.
don't play the cop with me, marion.
take that back!  fucking take that back. i'm not a cop any more.
i take it back. you're not a cop any more. you're a store detective.
are you drunk?
probably.
this fucking job's getting to you. you haven't written a fucking word since you started.
do you have to swear all the time?
well, that's my poor upbringing. i didn't go to no private school. i haven't got no class. i want to live with a writer. not a fucking croupier. i don't even know what the word means. croupier.
marion, stop this.
what do i mean to you? i want to know. tell me.
you're my conscience.
haven't you got a conscience of your own?
what are you doing here?  you know the rules.
what about a drink on the way home?
i don't finish till eight. make it nine and you're on.
i'm on at nine.
well, that's our life now, isn't it?
oh hello.
you know what? i'd like to buy you a drink.
it's against the rules. dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
that's stupid. what are the odds of you being seen with me?
impossible to calculate.
to coincidence.
there's a casino in this hotel.
i'm not much of a gambler really. i just like this bar.
so why did you come to my casino?
i was at a loose end. a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
first visit to london?
no, no. i come every couple of years. i always think i'm going to stay. i'm from cape town originally
i was born in the transkei, on the wild coast.
near the casino.
in the casino.
now there's a coincidence. my father used to gamble there.
your father?
i loved the atmosphere. but it destroyed my poor mother.
the debts.
and the lies. gamblers are born liars.
and superstitious too. it's like witchcraft.
that's africa. there's an african in all of us, isn't there?
we all came from africa, supposedly.
do you believe in astrology?
absolutely not. but then, i'm a gemini and geminis don't believe in astrology.
i'm not married. i wear it to keep the flies off.  i must go. let me pay for this.
absolutely not.
toss you for it.
i don't gamble.
i can't give you a lift back tonight.
don't worry.
jack. do you need a ride?
no. thanks.
my car's in the garage.
maybe another time.
i'll take you up on that.
goodnight.
you don't recognise me? you had me barred. you fucking little worm.
wait a minute. you got yourself barred.
it was you, you shit.
you're shaking.
it's the tension.
i hate cheats.
all men are cheats.
but don't worry, i'm clean as a whistle. i only did s & m.  no blow jobs. no screwing.
why did you quit?
i got scared.
i can imagine.
can you? i'm happy being a dealer. at least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
you called the casino a cesspit.
well it is. but i know where i am.
i've been watching you work. you're the best in the place. but you know that.
i despise the job.
ah, we all say that. but if we hate it, why do we do it?
the indian rope-trick.
look, now i'm pumping you. i'm sorry. it's none of my business. it's just that you're not like the others.
not like matt, you mean.
now he's a real shit. don't get friendly with him. i'm sure he's got his hand in the till. you know what he said to me once? "i want to fuck the whole world over. that's my mission." the shit!
ouch.
sorry.
rough day?
rough life, jack.
what happened to bella?
i'll tell you later.
i don't like it.
why not?
i don't like it at all. you had a wonderful character before, the gambler. he was so romantic.
he was a loser. this guy's a croupier. he can't lose. people have shat on him all his life. now he's in control. he's a winner.
is that your idea of a winner? he doesn't give a shit about anyone. he uses people and --
-- it's because of the sex, isn't it? you don't like the sex in it.
i don't give a fuck about the sex. most men'll fuck a lamppost. he's just a miserable zombie. is that the way you feel now? is that what's happened to you?
marion. it's a book.
oh really. then why is he called jake. why don't you come clean and call him jack.  there's no hope in it.
it's the truth.
without hope there's no point to anything.
now wait a minute. what's so hopeful about your job? spending the day catching poor people stealing. you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. at least in the casino everybody gets caught. rich or poor, the odds are the same. it's all relative.
crap. it's not relative. it's unfair. like your casino. it's designed unfair. and your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
the door, jack.
leave it.
no. answer it!
you fucking little shit! you shopped me.
what are you talking about?
reynolds got a doctor in. they forced me to take a dope test. it was positive. as you knew.
i don't know anything about it.
your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. what do you think of that? i can't get a job now.  you bastard. you're no different from matt. a pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
look bella, i don't know anything about this. you should talk to matt.
you're all scumbags.
he's paying out in stacks of 25.
i can see.
thanks for the information.
a pleasure. pity about bella.
she was a real asset. but what could i do?
i thought it was you. it's the hair!
i'm working on that soccer story.
right.  look, i must get back to habib.
habib?
my author. he's a terrorist. he's written a kill-and-tell book.  take care.
jack, look, next weekend i'm having a house party. here...  it's near oxford. why don't you come? it'll just be social. no business.  bring a friend. i've plenty of room.
i'll try and make it.
looking forward!
how did you hurt your hand?
just an accident. nothing.
turn left ahead.
jani, there's something i want to say. before we get there. i don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. giles probably expects us to share a room.
that's fine.
she's a dab hand with a racquet, your friend.
south african women are very sporty.
i found her in bed with someone.
who was he?
she.
i don't gamble.
don't be a spoilsport. it's only a few quid.
it's nothing to do with money. i don't gamble.
he doesn't gamble.
i'll watch.
last hand.
hey. i've got an idea. why don't we...
i get it.
get what?  are you accusing me of cheating?
good god, no. but with skill like that, what do you want a job for? you don't need to work.
what happened?
remember the guy who cheated at the table?
you don't like cheats, do you.
which side do you like?
you choose.
that trick tonight, i don't think i've ever seen that before.
it can only work with amateurs, a pro would have spotted it.
i didn't.
then you're not a pro.
i'm in trouble.
what kind of trouble?
i owe a lot of money.
was that why you did the two grand? i couldn't help you.
i know that. but you can now.
i don't have any money.  switches on the light. jani is looking distressed.
some people i know, they're planning to rob the golden lion.
they mean it.
who's they?
my creditors. one night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
forget it, jani. it'll never work.
the point is, they want a man inside.
and i thought you were a bright woman.
just listen. you don't have to do anything criminal.
robbery's not criminal?
you don't have to be criminal. a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. you'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. there'll be chaos. and that's when it'll happen.
you're serious.
you won't be committing a crime. the man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
and i thought you were only after my body.
i've come to know you. you're honest.  i trust you.
what'll you do when it all goes wrong?
it won't.
but if it does.
you keep the ten thousand pounds.
what ten thousand pounds?
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. they want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. that's the point. not all dealers are honest. mr reynolds will never suspect you.
reynolds? you've done your research.
next time it'll be my neck.
what about my neck?
i want to go back to cape town, i want to start again, clean.
i can't do it, jani.
i'm asking you, as a...friend. you'd be saving the life of a friend.
i want you to forget what i said.
wait a minute...
no, forget it. the bet's off.
how much do you owe?
let it go.
did they tell you to sleep with me?
i told you, all bets are off.
i'm sorry.
what for?
i have to take the car.
good night?
not particularly.
and your lady?
she had to leave early. she asked me to thank you.
a bit unexpected, wasn't it?
not entirely.
how's that football story corning along?
you said it was going to be social, giles. no business.
it's beautiful. thank you.
i hope it brings you luck.
it will.
that girl, she works at the casino --
-- i don't care about her. of course, i was angry. but not with you. the book is yours not mine. i was wrong, what i said about it. i hurt you, didn't i?
you're entitled to your opinion.
it's none of my business what you write. and your job, that's none of my business either. i love you. and i've done everything wrong.
i'll leave the casino soon.  i promise.
you will?
within a month. believe me, i'm going to quit!
what?
you were talking in your sleep.
not talking. writing.
is it yes?
yes.
thank you.
it doesn't seem fair. you're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
well, life's not fair. we know that.
it's all relative.  i need the money too.
do you?
yes.
the date's not set yet. i'll call you. one last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. but you know how to deal with cheats.
that bruise has cleared up nicely.
bruise?  oh, yes. it's better.
i've still got mine.
and your hand too.
i took the bandage off yesterday.
would you like a drink?
no thank you.
i don't think we should meet again.
it's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
never. why do you ask?
i can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
gambling's not about money.
really?
gambling's about not facing reality. ignoring the odds.
how did you know i was here?
i thought you wouldn't want to spend christmas day alone in here.
i don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
there was a message, wasn't there?
it's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
marion!  what did you tell the police?
nothing about you.
then what?
give up being a croupier, jack. or i'll shop you. all you have to do is keep your word. it's that simple.
here...use a spoon.
leave me alone, marion.
you're already alone.
why did you take the money?
i hate public transport.
what?
i want to buy a car.
how can anyone be that naive?
how do you feel, jack?
bruised.
take your time. two weeks. three if you need it. we'll pay you sick leave. i don't want to lose you. you're a good man. here...
detective inspector ross.
who...
ross.
who did it? tell me!
of course i recognised him!
you did?
i know a cheat when i see one. the man was a cheat.
what? you know what happened to me, don't you? that bitch bella shopped me. i'd like to beat the shit out of her.
i'd like to buy you a drink.
cheers. happy new year. i really like you, jacko, you're so fucking straight.  hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
you've been avoiding me.
have i?
i'm lucy.
and what do you do, lucy?
i'm a witch. a white witch. why don't we move on?
are you going to put a spell on me?
i might.
nice car. how much did you pay for it?
too much. eighteen hundred.
where to?
turn left at the lights.
hello...
jack! it's jani.
jani! where are you?
sun city. i've been meaning to call you for months.
how are you?
great. i'm getting married. at least, i think i am.
did you solve your problems?
yes. i'm all over that now. jack, hold on a minute. there's someone here who wants to talk to you...
what are you laughing at? who was that on the phone?
a couple i know are getting married.
three years, two months. march '93.
what a memory you've got. maths always was your strong suit. what happened to the moaning lisa?
she went back to south africa.
did she?  you were pretty thick at one time.
we all played the field.
hi-ya... i'll call you back.  now then...
i want a job, giles.
all right. as what?
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader. you employ readers, don't you?
we do. for unsolicited manuscripts. we pay twenty pounds a manuscript. you might get two, maybe three in a week. can you live on sixty pounds?
great.
found a job?
no.
well i've got something for you. in london, i mean. i've been chatting to some friends. do you know the golden lion casino? it's in bayswater, i believe... they're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
don't be stubborn. the pay won't be grand, but it's regular. that's what you need, isn't it? i know you don't like taking my advice...
it's not that.
i've set this up for you. call the golden lion and ask for mr reynolds, he's the manager. i don't know him personally, but i've spoken to his boss. don't say no, jacko. give yourself a break.
for christ's sake, jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. have you written that name down? reynolds, at the golden lion.
all right, dad. yes, i'll call him.
so how are you doing, dad?
great. i've just started a new company. solid financing. it's good.  i love you jacko, you know that
yes, i know that.
don't let yourself down.
i won't.  goodbye, dad.
david reynolds, i'm the manager here. sit down, john.
jack.
you've been recommended by the management here. they know your father. he has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
has he?
in any case, i understand you've had some previous experience... in south africa.  you'll find the rules a little different here. before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
no.
where did you go to school?
i was at beadles.
i don't think i know that one. private, i suppose.
there are three types of casino in the u.k. high volume. small faction. and motr. that's middle of the road. us.
do you have a salon prive?
we tried. but there wasn't enough business. the punters like company.
i have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
we check every four days.
why four? and not three or five?
it's the procedure here. now sort the chips.
stacks of 20. rows of 5.
any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
give me 365.
you use two alternating, don't you?
we do.
where's the magnet?
they've been tested.
haven't you forgotten something?
i don't think so.
wipe your hands.
not with your own cloth. besides, your pockets will be stitched.
what happens if i want to sneeze?
you won't. not without permission.
how many aces are left?
five.
i make it six.
five.
what makes you so sure?
it's a rule. always stand by your first count. the odds are you're right.

girlfriend?
yes.
she's not in the gaming business is she?
no.
this is our crow's nest. i'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
very impressive.
we have tapes in here that go back six months. let me show you something.
you can start monday week.
fine.
that hair will have to go.
fine.
i just want the job.
jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
what kind of deal you looking to?
what's the blue book price?
that's not relevant. an old car like this, it depends on the condition.
how about fifteen hundred?
how about five hundred.
what?!
how about we split the diff... seven-fifty.
is that your idea of arithmetic?
i'm not a mathematician. i'm in business.
eight-fifty.
seven-fifty.
i couldn't resist them.
you mean i won't resist them.
no, no. i'm not ready for you. there's some vodka in the freezer.
you want me drunk?
i won't be that long.
you really are a beautiful woman.
it's not just inner beauty, is it?
turn around.
where did you get it?
i. sold the car.
you shouldn't have done that. i know what it meant to you.
i owe you for the rent. it's only a car. i can get another.
take it back. till you sell your book.
come on, marion. let's face the truth. nobody's going to publish it.
of course they will. you just have to be patient. i'm betting on you.
you're my prisoner.
i've got something to tell you.
i want to hear it.
i've got a job.
what job?
in a casino. as a croupier. a dealer.
how did you land that?
it came my way. 450 a week.
450? what did you do, just walked in and said i want to be a croupier? don't you need training?
i had training. in the republic.
you were a croupier there? you never told me that. i thought you just knew some gamblers.
i start monday week.
you sold the car. you got a job. what's the third thing? tell me.
there's no third thing. don't be superstitious.
i love you jack, you know that.
are you trying to read my palm?
you've got such beautiful hands.
i'm bella.
jack manfred.
hi, jack.  welcome to the cesspit.
is it that bad?
how do i look?
why don't you take a break, jack.
all right, mr reynolds.
mr tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with bella.
does he win?
he's a good customer.
where do you live, jack?
over the river.
have you got transport?
i'm going over the river. i'll give you a lift if you like.
thanks.
so how do you feel, your first night? i'll bet you're on a high.
nice car.
she's my baby.
how long have you worked at the casino?
coming up to two years now.  but i was away for six months.
you've done pretty well.
not bad. i have other interests, of course.
i'm off to a little watering hole. why don't you join me? relax.
no thanks, matt. i need my eight hours.
i'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. in this job you have to unwind. otherwise it'll kill you. i mean that.
some other time.
what's the time?
i don't know.
how did it go?
fine.
you're shaking. what is it?
tension. it'll go.
poor baby.  this'll relax you.
i loved it blond.
it's only hair. i haven't changed.
when you get home, i'm asleep. when i leave home, you're asleep.
i'll see you in my dreams.
i'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
what are you talking about? it's 11, i've won. with this lady.
you've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
i put them on together.
i'm afraid that's not so, sir.
i'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the uk. it's different in south africa.
you know where i'm from?
i've lived there.
well, thank you anyway.
look matt, there's something i have to say to you. i saw you cheating.
what the fuck are you talking about?
that greek guy who won at the end. you paid him out in 25s not 20s.
i don't cheat, jack. you've got it wrong.
i'm not going to report it.
what are you, a cop?
if i see you do it again, i'll report it.
i don't get you. even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
because if a supervisor knew i'd seen you and i hadn't reported it, i'd lose my job as well. and i can't afford that.
so it's mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing but legal theft. and that's ok. it's the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. we earn our money.  i'm on your side, jack. i don't need an enemy.
you're talking about complicity.
i don't know what that means. i'm talking about not rocking the boat.
who are these guys?
mostly people in the casino business. a few drug dealers.
and the girls?
just girls. what are you drinking?
vodka. straight. on the rocks.
good call. help yourself.
does bella come here?
that bitch? no.
hey jack, join us.
no thanks.
don't worry, i won't report you!
i don't gamble.
i'm off. i need to sleep.
loosen up, jack. if you don't, this job'll get to you. the pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
"the world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." ernest hemingway.
where've you been? i've got to give evidence in court at nine.
don't play the cop with me, marion.
take that back!  fucking take that back. i'm not a cop any more.
i take it back. you're not a cop any more. you're a store detective.
are you drunk?
probably.
this fucking job's getting to you. you haven't written a fucking word since you started.
do you have to swear all the time?
well, that's my poor upbringing. i didn't go to no private school. i haven't got no class. i want to live with a writer. not a fucking croupier. i don't even know what the word means. croupier.
marion, stop this.
what do i mean to you? i want to know. tell me.
you're my conscience.
haven't you got a conscience of your own?
what are you doing here?  you know the rules.
what about a drink on the way home?
i don't finish till eight. make it nine and you're on.
i'm on at nine.
well, that's our life now, isn't it?
oh hello.
you know what? i'd like to buy you a drink.
it's against the rules. dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
that's stupid. what are the odds of you being seen with me?
impossible to calculate.
to coincidence.
there's a casino in this hotel.
i'm not much of a gambler really. i just like this bar.
so why did you come to my casino?
i was at a loose end. a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
first visit to london?
no, no. i come every couple of years. i always think i'm going to stay. i'm from cape town originally
i was born in the transkei, on the wild coast.
near the casino.
in the casino.
now there's a coincidence. my father used to gamble there.
your father?
i loved the atmosphere. but it destroyed my poor mother.
the debts.
and the lies. gamblers are born liars.
and superstitious too. it's like witchcraft.
that's africa. there's an african in all of us, isn't there?
we all came from africa, supposedly.
do you believe in astrology?
absolutely not. but then, i'm a gemini and geminis don't believe in astrology.
i'm not married. i wear it to keep the flies off.  i must go. let me pay for this.
absolutely not.
toss you for it.
i don't gamble.
i can't give you a lift back tonight.
don't worry.
jack. do you need a ride?
no. thanks.
my car's in the garage.
maybe another time.
i'll take you up on that.
goodnight.
you don't recognise me? you had me barred. you fucking little worm.
wait a minute. you got yourself barred.
it was you, you shit.
you're shaking.
it's the tension.
i hate cheats.
all men are cheats.
but don't worry, i'm clean as a whistle. i only did s & m.  no blow jobs. no screwing.
why did you quit?
i got scared.
i can imagine.
can you? i'm happy being a dealer. at least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
you called the casino a cesspit.
well it is. but i know where i am.
i've been watching you work. you're the best in the place. but you know that.
i despise the job.
ah, we all say that. but if we hate it, why do we do it?
the indian rope-trick.
look, now i'm pumping you. i'm sorry. it's none of my business. it's just that you're not like the others.
not like matt, you mean.
now he's a real shit. don't get friendly with him. i'm sure he's got his hand in the till. you know what he said to me once? "i want to fuck the whole world over. that's my mission." the shit!
ouch.
sorry.
rough day?
rough life, jack.
what happened to bella?
i'll tell you later.
i don't like it.
why not?
i don't like it at all. you had a wonderful character before, the gambler. he was so romantic.
he was a loser. this guy's a croupier. he can't lose. people have shat on him all his life. now he's in control. he's a winner.
is that your idea of a winner? he doesn't give a shit about anyone. he uses people and --
-- it's because of the sex, isn't it? you don't like the sex in it.
i don't give a fuck about the sex. most men'll fuck a lamppost. he's just a miserable zombie. is that the way you feel now? is that what's happened to you?
marion. it's a book.
oh really. then why is he called jake. why don't you come clean and call him jack.  there's no hope in it.
it's the truth.
without hope there's no point to anything.
now wait a minute. what's so hopeful about your job? spending the day catching poor people stealing. you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. at least in the casino everybody gets caught. rich or poor, the odds are the same. it's all relative.
crap. it's not relative. it's unfair. like your casino. it's designed unfair. and your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
the door, jack.
leave it.
no. answer it!
you fucking little shit! you shopped me.
what are you talking about?
reynolds got a doctor in. they forced me to take a dope test. it was positive. as you knew.
i don't know anything about it.
your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. what do you think of that? i can't get a job now.  you bastard. you're no different from matt. a pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
look bella, i don't know anything about this. you should talk to matt.
you're all scumbags.
he's paying out in stacks of 25.
i can see.
thanks for the information.
a pleasure. pity about bella.
she was a real asset. but what could i do?
i thought it was you. it's the hair!
i'm working on that soccer story.
right.  look, i must get back to habib.
habib?
my author. he's a terrorist. he's written a kill-and-tell book.  take care.
jack, look, next weekend i'm having a house party. here...  it's near oxford. why don't you come? it'll just be social. no business.  bring a friend. i've plenty of room.
i'll try and make it.
looking forward!
how did you hurt your hand?
just an accident. nothing.
turn left ahead.
jani, there's something i want to say. before we get there. i don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. giles probably expects us to share a room.
that's fine.
she's a dab hand with a racquet, your friend.
south african women are very sporty.
i found her in bed with someone.
who was he?
she.
i don't gamble.
don't be a spoilsport. it's only a few quid.
it's nothing to do with money. i don't gamble.
he doesn't gamble.
i'll watch.
last hand.
hey. i've got an idea. why don't we...
i get it.
get what?  are you accusing me of cheating?
good god, no. but with skill like that, what do you want a job for? you don't need to work.
what happened?
remember the guy who cheated at the table?
you don't like cheats, do you.
which side do you like?
you choose.
that trick tonight, i don't think i've ever seen that before.
it can only work with amateurs, a pro would have spotted it.
i didn't.
then you're not a pro.
i'm in trouble.
what kind of trouble?
i owe a lot of money.
was that why you did the two grand? i couldn't help you.
i know that. but you can now.
i don't have any money.  switches on the light. jani is looking distressed.
some people i know, they're planning to rob the golden lion.
they mean it.
who's they?
my creditors. one night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
forget it, jani. it'll never work.
the point is, they want a man inside.
and i thought you were a bright woman.
just listen. you don't have to do anything criminal.
robbery's not criminal?
you don't have to be criminal. a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. you'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. there'll be chaos. and that's when it'll happen.
you're serious.
you won't be committing a crime. the man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
and i thought you were only after my body.
i've come to know you. you're honest.  i trust you.
what'll you do when it all goes wrong?
it won't.
but if it does.
you keep the ten thousand pounds.
what ten thousand pounds?
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. they want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. that's the point. not all dealers are honest. mr reynolds will never suspect you.
reynolds? you've done your research.
next time it'll be my neck.
what about my neck?
i want to go back to cape town, i want to start again, clean.
i can't do it, jani.
i'm asking you, as a...friend. you'd be saving the life of a friend.
i want you to forget what i said.
wait a minute...
no, forget it. the bet's off.
how much do you owe?
let it go.
did they tell you to sleep with me?
i told you, all bets are off.
i'm sorry.
what for?
i have to take the car.
good night?
not particularly.
and your lady?
she had to leave early. she asked me to thank you.
a bit unexpected, wasn't it?
not entirely.
how's that football story corning along?
you said it was going to be social, giles. no business.
it's beautiful. thank you.
i hope it brings you luck.
it will.
that girl, she works at the casino --
-- i don't care about her. of course, i was angry. but not with you. the book is yours not mine. i was wrong, what i said about it. i hurt you, didn't i?
you're entitled to your opinion.
it's none of my business what you write. and your job, that's none of my business either. i love you. and i've done everything wrong.
i'll leave the casino soon.  i promise.
you will?
within a month. believe me, i'm going to quit!
what?
you were talking in your sleep.
not talking. writing.
is it yes?
yes.
thank you.
it doesn't seem fair. you're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
well, life's not fair. we know that.
it's all relative.  i need the money too.
do you?
yes.
the date's not set yet. i'll call you. one last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. but you know how to deal with cheats.
that bruise has cleared up nicely.
bruise?  oh, yes. it's better.
i've still got mine.
and your hand too.
i took the bandage off yesterday.
would you like a drink?
no thank you.
i don't think we should meet again.
it's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
never. why do you ask?
i can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
gambling's not about money.
really?
gambling's about not facing reality. ignoring the odds.
how did you know i was here?
i thought you wouldn't want to spend christmas day alone in here.
i don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
there was a message, wasn't there?
it's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
marion!  what did you tell the police?
nothing about you.
then what?
give up being a croupier, jack. or i'll shop you. all you have to do is keep your word. it's that simple.
here...use a spoon.
leave me alone, marion.
you're already alone.
why did you take the money?
i hate public transport.
what?
i want to buy a car.
how can anyone be that naive?
how do you feel, jack?
bruised.
take your time. two weeks. three if you need it. we'll pay you sick leave. i don't want to lose you. you're a good man. here...
detective inspector ross.
who...
ross.
who did it? tell me!
of course i recognised him!
you did?
i know a cheat when i see one. the man was a cheat.
what? you know what happened to me, don't you? that bitch bella shopped me. i'd like to beat the shit out of her.
i'd like to buy you a drink.
cheers. happy new year. i really like you, jacko, you're so fucking straight.  hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
you've been avoiding me.
have i?
i'm lucy.
and what do you do, lucy?
i'm a witch. a white witch. why don't we move on?
are you going to put a spell on me?
i might.
nice car. how much did you pay for it?
too much. eighteen hundred.
where to?
turn left at the lights.
hello...
jack! it's jani.
jani! where are you?
sun city. i've been meaning to call you for months.
how are you?
great. i'm getting married. at least, i think i am.
did you solve your problems?
yes. i'm all over that now. jack, hold on a minute. there's someone here who wants to talk to you...
what are you laughing at? who was that on the phone?
a couple i know are getting married.
