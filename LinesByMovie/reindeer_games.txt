no, not that, no...  i mean this, the whole thing. start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. get a boyfriend like this. tell me the truth.
well. you are not the first guy i wrote to. but you are the only one i kept writing to.
yeah. me too.  why? i mean i know why for me, why i paid for the ad. but you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you do not even know?
i told you, nick. remember?
tell me again.
all the guys I have ever been with... they never want to know me. who i am on the inside. they just want to qet inside. when they do, they think that means they know who i am. that i trust them. that they know me. that there is nothing left to learn.  a guy like you, nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. i figure a guy in that kind of bind, he is going to hafta work to get to know me some other way.
had some bad relationships, did not you.
not bad. just regular.  you wrote me wonderful things, nick. personal things.
well, was not all me, y'know.
yes it was all you --
guy i was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you would like him --
I am talking about the heart, nick. I am not talking about the words.
y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
then he shoulda signed his name.
where the hell are you going?
provisions! we are not leaving that motel room again till after new year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  what is good?!
ashley, jesus --
can not survive on our bodies alone, nick.  hurry up!
ash... did not you write me that you do not eat chocolate?
yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  so do not talk to me about little white lies.
you need a coat!
ash, you have gotten me enough --
no boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!

he did not "find" nick's letters, did he.
nick, please, it is me --
you told him about nick's letters.
no, nick, no --
you are in on this.
i love you!
your pen palls dead, lady.
if you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. if they think you are not you, they will kill you. do not you see? i know what you are doing, but it will not work!
nick died for me....
i will not let him hurt you! he just wants what you know!
...maybe i die for nick...
just tell him what you know, nick! that is all they want! and we will get out of this!
you are a good writer, nick. i give this writing an a-plus.
i never worked at no casino.
gabriel, you promised!
i promised that when he helped us, we would be gone! when he helped us! loverboy do not want to play!
you promised me!
and you promised me you would get your sweetheart to help!
he would rather die than be with you, he would make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  bury him all over the place.
no!
hey. she says she loves you, nick.
she says a lot of things.
she is getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you are dead. you just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. my sister loves you, motherfucker, and i am not going to have you break her heart.
wish i had a brother like you.
a girl says she loves you, you say something.
i had better sex in prison.
heyyy. be nice, convict. we are going to be working together here.  get him back in the rig.

what is her greatest fear?
her brother.
wrong, nick. it is drowning.
no. it is her brother.
let's get back on the road. it is time to start talking, nick. time to start telling tales --
nick do not talk till nick gets something.
you want that for here or to go?
i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, I am back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
you knew the place --
hey.
gabriel! you said talk to him. that is all you ever said...
we are talking, are not we?
how much money's in that casino? day-to-day.
i do not know.
the hell you don't.
five million?
you wrote ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working christmas eve, bout how they would send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. and the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. that a true story now?
christmas... eve...
you know where the guards are. you know how to get in and out. you know where the money is.  we are taking down that casino, convict. you are the guy going to tell us how.
hey, it's... been two years --
we got faith in you, nick mason.  you are our inside man.
here ya go, convict. we cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. what you are going to do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
and where they hide the real money.
hell. ten?
and which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
start talkin
who the hell made this map.
what?
i said, who the hell made the map?
i did.
this is not the tomahawk.
what the fuck are you talking about.
this is the front entrance, right? you get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. blackjack's here to here -- lined up. what is this, the cage? cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
that is what it looks like!
since when? what the hell is this room?
buffet. whaddya think it is?
buffet is by the goddamn bar! what the hell kind of map is this?!
we walked the place for a week.
and i worked there. for a year.
map is kinda dirty, monster...
they changed the layout.
they changed the layout -- whadda they call you? mr. monster? they remodeled the place. when i worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
jack. jack bangs.
right, jack bangs. uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. maybe get a better crowd. musta gone and done it while i was in the mountain.  i do not know this map, man. how the hell am i supposed to tell you what door goes where?
they would not have changed the security setup.
when i worked there, this was bangs, office. back here. he kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the indians. called it the... uh...  ...the powwow safe.
the powwow safe?
his personal safe, he gave it a name. now you are telling me they have taken his office, put the buffet there? then who knows what else they changed.
so what the hell good are you...
you would have to get me inside.  get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. then i could work with your map.
wrong, convict. you walk in there, they recognize you.
they will not recognize me.
why not.
trust me. they will not recognize me.
we will trust you when we are rich. why not.
'cause you are going to get me a disguise.
bring back some memories, nick?
more than you know.
rather be back in the mountain?
might as well be.
do not have weather channel in the mountain, nick.
he said he wanted to talk to you. when he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, i wanna talk to him." i thought he meant back in detroit. i thought he meant --
but you knew why. knew why, did not ya.
i thought we would have a few more days.
for what? you to talk me into "helping"? what, he promise you a share of the winnings?
no!
well, shit, judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
nick! he wants to know how to rob it, and he will leave you alone! that is all he wants!  i hate him, nick... you know how...
so get him outta your life. get out of michigan. they got perfume counters in chicago, do not they?
not without you.
since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
they run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. but gabriel knows some guys in new york, miami, guys he helps get guns to detroit. hides 'em with his regular loads.
he working for them on this one?
no. he wants to be working for himself someday.
and I am his ticket.  what is the last place they took down?
what?
gabriel and his guys. what is the last place they robbed?
they have never done a robbery?
they are truck drivers.
then they do need me, do not they. they really need me...
we are going to get out of here, nick. we are going to get out of this...
we? what "we"...
get your own room, ashley.
nick...
get your own room.
having romance problems, romeo?
not with you.
goddamn, merlin. there any part of the day you do not smoke?
there anytime you do not got a mouthful of shit?
cancer-sucker.
acid-chewer.
a cowboy. you are going to send me into an indian casino disguised as a cowboy. have you thought this entirely through?
put it on.
you are a country-western singer up from nashville for the the holidays. visiting your grandma on the lake, driving into the tomahawk for some scotch and slots. you only play the slots, you got that? do not want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
what kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
you do.
at least gimme video poker.
shut the fuck up. you play what your girlfriend plays. ashley's going in with you. you talk to her, otherwise you do not talk to nobody. you walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, i want to know the run of the place.
do i get a country-western name?
you get recognized, convict, you get a country-western funeral.
y'know what, guys? i woke up this morning, i got a really lucky feeling going on. i mean it, I am feeling that good. i would not be surprised if i walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. hell, we would not even have to --
get out.
you got one hour.
I am going to need some money.
ten dollars? what do i do with ten dollars?
do not tip.
monster. if we are working together here, we got to be working together. i can not walk in there looking like the lone fucking ranger with ten bucks to throw down. you do not want me getting noticed, right? not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
who is robbin' who here, gabriel...
get in there and watch 'em. watch their every fuckin' move.
there is no snow in vegas, 'kay? they do not know it, they do not want it, they got laws against the stuff. they got egypt down there, right, they got monte carlo, hawaii, they got ancient rome, but where is the winter castle, right? where is the swiss miss chalet? where is the big fucking igloo?
we understand you, mr. bangs.
capades? they do not do it. mittens? outlawed. why?
we are aware of your position.
because down there this is money. up here this is heat.  you wanted vegas quality, i brought it to you. you wanted vegas press, i gave it to you. but guys, please, guys... i can not get you vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
I am bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three russian girls, they look like meryl streep, they can juggle anything.
mr. bangs.
guys. we are doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? nobody does that in michigan. nobody.
the tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
I am putting liquor in the drinks, I am giving 10-times odds on craps, i got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! show me another buffet's going to offer you coke and pepsi! whaddya want me to do?!
we want to see our casino making money again, mr. bangs. making money for our community.
so does it look a lot different?
here and there. restaurant, uh, that is the main expansion. tables've been moved around; the big man's office, i dunno, might be upstairs now.
that guy knows you?
yeah, uh. mike. that is mike.
what the hell was that about --
he did not recognize me. back off, willya? he did not recognize me.
nick, what happened --
there went my... damn... well, does not seem like security's all that switched... ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. i got to fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
thanks, sister. how are ya.
fuckin' freezing.
hell yeah. you work here long?
five years. since it opened.
how long ago was your makeover?
my what?!
no, the place. the remodeling. moving everything around.
where the hell did he go?
monster. there never was a structure change. this place was built the same from day one.
that motherfucker --
and monster... he was talking with the casino manager. nick was talking to him.
we get to the bridge, we are all right!
nick, the ice is --
get to the bridge!  hey! hey! down here!
a for effort, nick, honestly, a for effort and an honorary degree. I am surprised you never escaped from the mountain.
...never... tried...
nick, here's what we are going to do. in the spirit of the season, I am going to give you a chance. i understand you are unhappy. right outta the lockup, here against your will, it is the holidays and there is reruns on tv.  so we are going to have a contest.
got something to say to me, nick?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
what did you tell that casino manager?
nnn... nothing...
you were talking to him! what did you tell him!?
nothing... i promise-nothing...
maybe something about a robbery?
no!
he thought i was some gambler... he did not know me... he did not recognize me!
i been driving rigs a long time, nick. four, five million miles of road. worked for people who would not keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, i needed rest, shit, they will hire someone else...
it is time for me... to be working for me. i want mine, nick. and i need you.  did you tell your manager there is going to be a robbery?
no, gabriel... no...
man, monster... just... just do not start trying to hit me...
nick. i been trying to hit you.
jesus christ, stay here, do not move, stay right here --
all i wanted... was to make it home... for a little of dad's turkey, and mom's stuffing... aunt lisbeth's acorn gravy... aunt mary's cranberry buns...
we will get there, baby... we will get there...
...haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
shh, now. rest now. two years, nick. you have not had cranberry buns in two years.
you saved my life.  you could have run, but you didn't. you saved me.
you saved me.
i saved you because i love you, nick.  why did you save me?
I am sorry, nick... I am so sorry...
do not say my name...
i love you, nick...
ash. do not say it. do not say my name.
they will have guns.
what?
you said they have run guns, in their trucks. so they will have guns. to do this robbery. they will have serious guns.
i do not know...
we will need one.
I am going to have to be inside that casino. when it happens. I will need to be part of it. i can not just be drawing some map.
nick, what are you talking about?
we need to find a way to make me part of it.
part of... with them?
knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. his lungs got so black they could not find 'em with an x-ray.
that right? shit. i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she did not know his situation. he is drunk, she is drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. sucks it right down.
my guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
his lips went next. you ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
start singing.
i have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
sing it in pictures, nick.
what you got to worry about first is the guards. place does not look much richer than when i worked there, so let's figure you are going to have to deal with ten of 'em. there'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. eyes in the sky. they see something up, they are the ones who will hit the silent alarm and you are fucked.
how do we take them out?
you gotta get someone upstairs.
how do we do that?
across from blackjack, there is a security doorway. keypad access.
what is the code?
uh... they change it every month. i would not know.  if there is trouble on the floor, you will get security coming through. what you got to do, is get inside that doorway once they do. you got to draw 'em out.
without having them hit the alarms.
i got an idea on that one. once you are up there, you got to hold those guards down till some backup can get there. there is a security camera room that videotapes everything. you have got to destroy every last one of those tapes.
what about the money?
you lock down security, you move behind the cage. you hit the count room. there'll be a guy in there but he is got no guns; room's accessed by another code. cashiers'll know it. they will have alarms.
what about the powwow safe?
what?
the powwow safe. the secret safe. you said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
oh. right. yeah. that's, uh upstairs. uh. here. powwow safe.
so. you are going to need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. you are going to need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  you need six.
we got five. putting ashley outside.
you need six.
no.
you go in with five, you are either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you are fucked. someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you are fucked. you need six.  six is me.
no.
you guys get caught, i go away for good. i got an interest in making sure you don't. you need a sixth man covering an exit. what are you going to do about it.
i want a map of that security level. every room, every guard, every thing.
six men means six guns.
no way.
I am no threat without a gun.
no, you are not.
there'll be people in that casino. i can not keep them from leaving if i do not get a gun. i do not need bullets, monster... but i got to be a threat.
no gun.
well. what you guys have to plan out, then... is how you are going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. running in with ski masks and bullets flying am not going to do it.
that part, nick... was planned out the day i read your letters.
what. we all gonna dress up like cowboys?
not cowboys, nick. not cowboys.
you gotta be kidding me.
it is the season, convict.
can not be attracting attention, right?
what, we walking in there and delivering toys?
he wants to see your map.
I am almost done.
he says he wants it now.
if he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I am working on it here.
how are we gonna do this, nick?
you are the getaway girl. the money's going to get to you eventually. going to be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can not do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?
bullets or no bullets, he will not do it.
is there any way you could get into his truck?
no.
we need a gun, ash. we need a gun...
here's the picasso. is he in his room?
they all are. football's on.
keep 'em there for a little while.
he wants the money.
no, baby. he wants me.
he wants... your "sister"...
...whoever she is.
all those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
to all those cons...
searching for a money man...
we musta written what, twenty of 'em? and they were before this guy. one, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in leavenworth --
-- till he fucked his parole --
-- plus the forty to mason... how many letters is that?
that is a book, baby.  that is a book of love.
i can not take watching you touch him. i can not take his hands on you.
one more day, baby. one more day to christmas.
I have been doing good, though.
did not have to hit me so fucking hard. did not have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.

what, he should see me help you catch him?
he is shown us the setup, he is drawn us the map, he is helped us do the plan. he wants a gun, give him a gun. take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. the more manpower we have got in there, the better. he will not try and make his move till the money's in hand.
he will be dead when he does.

millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. i was in the mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
she set them up. all of them.
why not have her pretend to find me? pretend to write me and reel me in? tell her new trucker-man she would pose as some sister of his named ashley?
and you set me up.
always wanted to rob that casino, rudy. way back when i worked there. what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. he is a lifer, what does he care. paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead. once the wound healed up...  got out of the mountain this morning. and tonight I am a rich man.
how did you know I would do it.
do what?
walk outta there and tell her i was you.
hell, you never needed to convince ashley you were me. just the dumb fucking truckers. i figured I would talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I would remember
hm. well. they would have killed you if you were not me, rudy. we knew you would start convincing 'em soon enough.
they had the weapons and the willpower. we just gave them their inside man.
you gave them me.
i gave them me.  said some nice things about me, rudy. i appreciate it. but do not worry. i do love her. and she loves me. you had that right all along.
