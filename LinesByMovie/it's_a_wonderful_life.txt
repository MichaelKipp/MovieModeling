hello, joseph, trouble?
looks like we will have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named george bailey.
george bailey. yes, tonight's his crucial night. you are right, we will have to send someone down immediately. whose turn is it?
that is why i came to see you, sir. it is that clock-maker's turn again.
oh  clarence. has not got his wings yet, has he? we have passed him up right along.
because, you know, sir, he is got the i.q. of a rabbit.
yes, but he is got the faith of a child  simple. joseph, send for clarence.
you sent for me, sir?
yes, clarence. a man down on earth needs our help.
splendid! is he sick?
no, worse. he is discouraged. at exactly ten-forty-five pm tonight, earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away god's greatest gift.
oh, dear, dear! his life! then I have only got an hour to dress. what are they wearing now?
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with george bailey.
sir . . . if i should accomplish this mission  i mean  might i perhaps win my wings? I have been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
what is that book you have got there?
the adventures of tom sawyer.
clarence, you do a good job with george bailey, and you will get your wings.
oh, thank you, sir. thank you.
poor george . . . sit down.

if you are going to help a man, you want to know something about him, do not you?
well, naturally. of course.
well, keep your eyes open. see the town?
where? i do not see a thing.
oh, i forgot. you have not got your wings yet. now look, I will help you out. concentrate. begin to see something?
why, yes. this is amazing.
if you ever get your wings, you will see all by yourself.
oh, wonderful!
hey, who is that?
that is your problem, george bailey.
a boy?
that is him when he was twelve, back in 1919. something happens here you will have to remember later on.
two cents worth of shoelaces?
she was here first.
made up your mind yet?
I will take chocolate.
with coconuts?
i do not like coconuts.
you do not like coconuts! say, brainless, do not you know where coconuts come from? lookit here  from tahiti  fiji islands, the coral sea!
a new magazine! i never saw it before.
of course you never. only us explorers can get it. I have been nominated for membership in the national geographic society.
george! george!
yes, sir.
you are not paid to be a canary.
no, sir.
mr. gower, do you want something . . . anything?
no.
anything i can do back here?
no.
yes, sir. they have the diphtheria there, have not they, sir?
ummmm . . .
is it a charge, sir?
yes  charge.
mr. gower, i think . . .
aw, get going!
yes, sir.
avast, there, captain cook! where you headin'?
got to see pop, uncle billy.
some other time, george.
it is important.
there is a squall in there that is shapin' up into a storm.
I am not crying, mr. potter.
well, you are begging, and that is a whole lot worse.
all I am asking is thirty days more . . .
pop!
have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
times are bad, mr. potter. a lot of these people are out of work.
then foreclose!
i can not do that. these families have children.
pop!
they are not my children.
but they are somebody is children.
are you running a business or a charity ward?
well, all right . . .
mr. potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? you have no family  no children. you can not begin to spend all the money you have got.
so i suppose i should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
no . . . no . . . no. . .
do not hurt my ear again!
mr. gower, i will not ever tell anyone. i know what you are feeling. i will not ever tell a soul. hope to die, i won't.
oh, george.
what did you stop it for?
i want you to take a good look at that face.
who is it?
george bailey.
oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
that is the kid.
it is a good face. i like it. i like george bailey. tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
not a soul.
did he ever marry the girl? did he ever go exploring?
well, wait and see.
big  see! i do not want one for one night. i want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from italy and baghdad, samarkand . . . a great big one.
i see, a flying carpet, huh? i do not suppose you would like this old second-hand job, would you?
now you are talkin'. gee whiz, i could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. how much does this cost?
no charge.
that is my trick ear, joe. it sounded as if you said no charge.
what boat you sailing on?
I am working across on a cattle boat.
a cattle boat?
mr. gower . . . mr. gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. it is just exactly what i wanted.
aw, forget it.
oh, it is wonderful.
hope you enjoy it.
hey, ernie!
hiya, george!
hi, bert.
george . . .
ernie, I am a rich tourist today. how about driving me home in style?
good afternoon, mr. bailey.
hello, violet. hey, you look good. that is some dress you got on there.
oh, you two idiots! george, sit down and have dinner.
I have eaten.
well, are not you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? look at you.
i do not care. it is george's tux.
pop, can i have the car? I am going to take over a lot of plates and things.
what plates?
oh, mom  I am chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
oh, no you don't. harry, now, not my best haviland.
hope you have a good trip, george. uncle billy and i are going to miss you.
I am going to miss you, too, pop. what is the matter? you look tired.
oh, i had another tussle with potter today.
oh . . .
i thought when we put him on the board of directors, he would ease up on us a little bit.
i wonder what is eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
oh, he is a sick man. frustrated and sick. sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. hates everybody that has anything that he can not have. hates us mostly, i guess.
got a match?
very funny. very funny.
put those things in the car and I will get your tie and studs together.
okay, mom. you coming later? you coming later, george?
what do you mean, and be bored to death?
could not want a better death. lots of pretty girls, and we are going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
i hope it works.
father, did i act like that when i graduated from high school?
pretty much. you know, george, wish we could send harry to college with you. your mother and i talked it over half the night.
we have that all figured out. you see, harry'll take my job at the building and loan, work there four years, then he will go.
he is pretty young for that job.
well, no younger than i was.
maybe you were born older, george.
how is that?
i say, maybe you were born older. i suppose you have decided what you are going to do when you get out of college.
oh, well, you know what I have always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff i was talking about.
still after that first million before you are thirty.
no, I will settle for half that in cash.
i know it is soon to talk about it.
oh, now, pop, i couldn't. i could not face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
yes . . . yes . . . you are right, son.
you see what i mean, do not you, pop?
this town is no place for any man unless he is willing to crawl to potter. you have got talent, son. you get yourself an education. then get out of here.
pop, do you want a shock? i think you are a great guy.
I am going to miss old annie. pop, i think I will get dressed and go over to harry's party.
have a good time, son.
oh, oh. sam wainwright! how are you? when did you get here?
oh, this afternoon. i thought I would give the kids a treat.
old college graduate now, huh?
yeah  old joe college wainwright, they call me. well, freshman, looks like you are going to make it after all.
yep.
hee-haw!
hee-haw!
hey, george . . .
hello, violet.
hello, what am i bid?
george.
hiya, marty. well, it is old home week.
do me a favor, will you, george?
what is that?
well, you remember my kid sister, mary?
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh . . . me? oh, well, i feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
aw, come on. be a sport. just dance with her one time and you will give her the thrill of her life.
well, hello.
hello. you look at me as if you did not know me.
well, i don't.
you have passed me on the street almost every day.
me?
uh-huh.
uh-uh. that was a little girl named mary hatch. that was not you.
I am not very good at this.
neither am i.
okay  what can we lose?
hot dog! just like an organ.
beautiful.
do i look as funny as you do?
i guess I am not quite the football type. you . . . look wonderful. you know, if it was not me talking I would say you were the prettiest girl in town.
well, why do not you say it?
i do not know. maybe i will say it. how old are you anyway?
eighteen.
eighteen? why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
too young or too old?
oh, no. just right. your age fits you. yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
your . . . your caboose, my lady.
you may kiss my hand.
ummmmm . . .
okay, then, I will throw a rock at the old granville house.
oh, no, don't. i love that old house.
oh, no, george, don't. it is full of romance, that old place. I would like to live in it.
in that place?
uh-huh.
i would not live in it as a ghost. now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
what did you wish, george?
well, not just one wish. a whole hatful, mary. i know what I am going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I am shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I am going to see the world. italy, greece, the parthenon, the colosseum. then I am coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I am going to build things. I am going to build air fields. I am going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I am going to build bridges a mile long . . .
oh, no.
come on, tell me.
if i told you it might not come true.
what is it you want, mary? what do you want? you want the moon? just say . . .
I will take it. and then what?
well, then you could swallow it and it would all dissolve, see? and the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  am i talking too much?
ouch!
gesundheit. this requires a little thought here.
they are way downtown. they would be on my side, too.
I am going to scream!
mary . . . mary, I am sorry. I have got to go.
come on, george, let's hurry.
did you get a doctor?
i want the board to know that george gave up his trip to europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. good luck to you at school, george.
thanks.
now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, peter bailey.
thank you very much.
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
yes, sir.
you see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. what does that get us? a discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. now, i say . . .
just a minute  just a minute. now, hold on, mr. potter. you are right when you say my father was no business man. i know that. why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante building and loan, I will never know. but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . why, in the twenty-five years since he and uncle billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. is not that right, uncle billy? he did not save enough money to send harry to school, let alone me. but he did help a few people get out of your slums, mr. potter. and what is wrong with that? why . . . here, you are all businessmen here. does not it make them better citizens? does not it make them better customers? you . . . you said . . . what did you say just a minute ago? . . . they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. wait! wait for what? until their children grow up and leave them? until they are so old and broken-down that they . . . do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? just remember this, mr. potter, that this rabble you are talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? anyway, my father did not think so. people were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they are cattle. well, in my book he died a much richer man than you will ever be!
I am not interested in your book. I am talking about the building and loan.
i know very well what you are talking about. you are talking about something you can not get your fingers on, and it is galling you. that is what you are talking about, i know.  well, I have said too much. i . . . you are the board here. you do what you want with this thing. just one thing more, though. this town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter. come on, uncle billy!
what is that?
that is the best part of it. they have appointed george here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
oh, no! but, uncle billy . . .
you can keep him on. that is all right. as secretary you can hire anyone you like.
i know. i know. he did not go.
that is right. not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother harry, and sent him to college. harry became a football star  made second team all american.
yes, but what happened to george?
uh-huh. breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
no, no, no, no! anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
peanut?
oh, am i glad to see you.
say, where is mother?
she is home cooking the fatted calf. come on, let's go.
oh, wait. wait . . . wait a minute.
hello.
how do you do.
well, what do you know  wife.
well, how do you do. congratulations. congratulations. what am i doing?
oh, thank you, george, old boy, old boy. now, look  if you will point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? george?
right down here.
old building and loan pal, huh . . .
now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
that way, huh?
she is swell.
looks like she can keep harry on his toes.
keep him out of bedford falls, anyway.
did you know that mary hatch is back from school?
uh-huh.
came back three days ago.
hmmmm . . .
nice girl, mary.
hmmmm . . .
kind that will help you find the answers, george.
hmmm . . .
oh, stop that grunting.
hmmm . . .
can you give me one good reason why you should not call on mary?
sure  sam wainwright.
hmmm?
yes. sam's crazy about mary.
well, she is not crazy about him.
well, how do you know? did she discuss it with you?
no.
well then, how do you know?
well, I have got eyes, have not i? why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you are around.
oh . . .
and besides, sam wainwright's away in new york, and you are here in bedford falls.
and all's fair in love and war?
mother, you know, i can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
uh-huh.
well, here's your hat, what is your hurry? all right, mother, old building and loan pal, i think I will go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
oh, george!
now, if you will just point me in the right direction . . . this direction?  good night, mrs. bailey.
hello, georgie-porgie.
hello, vi.
what gives?
nothing.
where are you going?
oh, I will probably end up down at the library.
let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
huh?
then we can go up to the falls. it is beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there is a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. then we can climb mt. bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we will stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
hello, mary. i just happened to be passing by.
yeah, so i noticed. have you made up your mind?
how is that?
have you made up your mind?
about what?
about coming in. your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
my mother just called you? well, how did she know?
did not you tell her?
i did not tell anybody. i just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
well, are you coming in or are not you?
well, I will come in for a minute, but i did not tell anybody i was coming over here.
when did you get back?
tuesday.
where did you get that dress?
do you like it?
it is all right. i thought you would go back to new york like sam and ingie, and the rest of them.
oh, i worked there for a couple of vacations, but i do not know . . . i guess i was homesick.
all right, for a minute. i still can not understand it though. you know i did not tell anybody i was coming here.
would you rather leave?
no, i do not want to be rude.
well, then, sit down.
well, i see it still smells like pine needles in here.
thank you.
oh . . . yeah, yeah. that is all right.
do not you like her?
well, of course i like her. she is a peach.
oh, it is just marriage in general you are not enthusiastic about, huh?
no, marriage is all right for harry, and marty, and sam and you.
i have a big deal coming up that is going to make us all rich. george, you remember that night in martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
huh? yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. yeah.
well, dad's snapped up the idea. he is going to build a factory outside of rochester. how do you like that?
rochester? well, why rochester?
well, why not? can you think of anything better?
oh, i do not know . . . why not right here? you remember that old tool and machinery works? you tell your father he can get that for a song. and all the labor he wants, too. half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
that so? well, I will tell him. hey, that sounds great! oh, baby, i knew you would come through. now, here's the point. mary, mary, you are in on this too. now listen. have you got any money?
money? yeah . . . well, a little.
well, now listen. i want you to put every cent you have got into our stock, you hear? and george, i may have a job for you; that is, unless you are still married to that broken-down building and loan. this is the biggest thing since radio, and I am letting you in on the ground floor. oh, mary . . . mary . . .
george . . . george . . . george . . .
mary . . .
if either of you two see a stranger around here, it is me.
hey, look! somebody is driving this cab.
bert, the cop, sent this over. he said to float away to happy land on the bubbles.
oh, look at this. champagne!
where are we going?  look at this. there is the kitty, ernie. here, come on, count it, mary.
i feel like a bootlegger's wife.  look!
you know what we are going to do? we are going to shoot the works. a whole week in new york. a whole week in bermuda. the highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
after that, who cares?
that does it  come here.
just a minute, dear. oh-oh . . .
please, let's not stop, george.
I will be back in a minute, mary.
what is this, uncle billy? a holiday?
george . . .
why did not you call me?
i just did, but they said you left. this is a pickle, george, this is a pickle.
all right now, what happened? how did it start?
how does anything like this ever start? all i know is the bank called our loan.
when?
about an hour ago. i had to hand over all our cash.
all of it?
every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
holy mackerel!
and then i got scared, george, and closed the doors. i . . . i . . . i . . .
the whole town's gone crazy.
yes, hello? george . . . it is potter.
hello?
george, was it a nice wedding? gosh, i wanted to be there.
yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
those rockefellers!
get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
we will save them for seed. a toast!
hey, this is the company's posters, and the company will not like this.
how would you like to get a ticket next week? have not you any romance in you?
sure i have, but i got rid of it.
come on, we got to get this up. he is coming.
who?
the groom, idiot. come on, get that ladder.
get that ladder up here.
all right  all right.
hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
I am hurrying.
oh, mary . . .
remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? this is what i wished for.
darling, you are wonderful.
what is that?
i own the house. me, giuseppe martini. i own my own house. no more we live like pigs in thisa potter's field. hurry, maria.
goodbye, everybody!
all in . . .
we just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we are going to drive on down to florida.
oh . . .
oh, I am afraid i could not get away, sam.
still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? jane, i offered to let george in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
oh, now, do not rub it in.
I am not rubbing it in. well, i guess we better run along.
so long, george. see you in the funny papers.
goodbye, sam.
have fun.
thanks for dropping around.
thank you, sir. quite a cigar, mr. potter.
you like it? I will send you a box.
yes. well, most people say you stole all the rest.
the envious ones say that, george, the suckers. now, i have stated my side very frankly. now, let's look at your side. young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
you would not mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to new york a year, maybe once in a while europe. you would not mind that, would you, george?
would i?  you are not talking to somebody else around here, are you? you know, this is me, you remember me? george bailey.
oh, yes, george bailey. whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
well, what about the building and loan?
oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I am offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. is it a deal or is not it?
well, mr. potter, i . . . i . . . i know i ought to jump at the chance, but i . . . i just . . . i wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
sure, sure, sure. you go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I would like to do that.
in the meantime, I will draw up the papers.
all right, sir.
hi.
hi.
mary hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
to keep from being an old maid.
you could have married sam wainwright or anybody else in town.
i did not want to marry anybody else in town. i want my baby to look like you.
you did not even have a honeymoon. i promised you . . .  . . . your what?
my baby.
george bailey lassos stork.
lassos the stork! you mean you . . . what is it, a boy or a girl?
now, you have probably already guessed that george never leaves bedford falls.
no!
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
yes, but george . . .
on v-j day he wept and prayed again.
joseph, now show him what happened today.
yes, sir.
good morning, sir.
carter  bank examiner.
mr. carter, merry christmas.
merry christmas.
we are all excited around here.  my brother just got the congressional medal of honor. the president just decorated him.
well, i guess they do those things. well, i trust you had a good year.
good year? well, between you and me, mr. carter, we are broke.
yeah, very funny.
well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, mr. carter.
i guess you forgot something.
huh?
you forgot something.
what?
well, are not you going to make a deposit?
sure, sure i am.
well, then . . it is usually customary to bring the money with you.
oh, shucks . . .
how about that one there?
hmm? well, i . . .
george, can i see you for a second?
why, of course you can. come on in the office here.
no, george, do not . . .
here, now, you are broke, are not you?
i know, but . . .
what do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? want to walk to new york? you know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in bedford falls.
say hello to new york for me.
yeah  yeah . . . sure i will.
now, let's hear from you . . .
now look, did you buy anything?
nothing. not even a stick of gum.
all right. all right. now we will go over every step you took since you left the house.
this way.
and did you put the envelope in your pocket?
yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
is it snowing?
yeah, just started.
where is your coat and hat?
left them at the office.
zuzu! what is the matter with zuzu?
oh, she is got a cold. she is in bed. caught it coming home from school. they gave her a flower for a prize and she did not want to crush it so she did not button up her coat.
what is it, a sore throat or what?
just a cold. the doctor says it is nothing serious.
the doctor? was the doctor here?
yes, i called him right away. he says it is nothing to worry about.
is she running a temperature? what is it?
just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. she will be all right.
where are you going?
going up to see zuzu.
hi, daddy.
well, what happened to you?
i won a flower.
wait now. where do you think you are going?
want to give my flower a drink.
all right, all right. here, give daddy the flower. I will give it a drink.
look, daddy . . . paste it.
yeah, all right. now, I will paste this together.
there it is, good as new.
give the flower a drink.
what?
will you try to get some sleep?
I am not sleepy. i want to look at my flower.
i know  i know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it will be a whole garden.
it will?
uh-huh.
yes, sir.
have you notified the police?
no, sir. i did not want the publicity. harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
no, sir. no, sir. i haven't.
what is it  a woman, then? you know, it is all over town that you have been giving money to violet bick.
not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? why do not you go to sam wainwright and ask him for the money?
i can not get hold of him. he is in europe.
well, what about all your other friends?
they do not have that kind of money, mr. potter. you know that. you are the only one in town that can help me.
i see. I have suddenly become quite important. what kind of security would i have, george? have you got any stocks?
yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
five hundred dollars.
he is gone. do not worry. his name is welch. he do not come in to my place no more.
oh  welch. that is what i get for praying.
the last time he come in here. you hear that, nick?
yes, you bet.
where is my insurance policy?  oh, here . . .
oh, no, please, do not go out this way, mr. bailey.
I am all right.
oh, no  you do not feel so good.
I am all right.
please do not go away  please!
you what? to save me?
well, i did, did not i? you did not go through with it, did you?
go through with what?
suicide.
oh, i know all about you. I have watched you grow up from a little boy.
what are you, a mind reader or something?
oh, no.
well, who are you, then?
clarence odbody, a-s-2.
odbody . . . a-s-2. what is that a-s-2?
angel, second class.
that is what i was sent down for. I am your guardian angel.
i would not be a bit surprised.
ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. eight thousand dollars.
i told you  I am your guardian angel. i know everything about you.
well, you look about like the kind of an angel I would get. sort of a fallen angel, are not you? what happened to your wings?
i have not won my wings yet. that is why I am an angel second class.
i do not know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
oh, I have got to earn them, and you will help me, will not you?
by letting me help you.
only one way you can help me. you do not happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
oh, no, no. we do not use money in heaven.
oh, that is right, i keep forgetting. comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
oh, tut, tut, tut.
i found it out a little late. I am worth more dead than alive.
now look, you must not talk like that. i will not get my wings with that attitude. you just do not know all that you have done. if it had not been for you . . .
what did you say?
i said i wish I would never been born.
oh, you must not say things like that. you . . .  . . . wait a minute. wait a minute. that is an idea.  what do you think? yeah, that will do it. all right.  you have got your wish. you have never been born.
what did you say?
you have never been born. you do not exist. you have not a care in the world.
well, that is the doggonedest thing . . . i have not heard anything out of that ear since i was a kid. must have been that jump in the cold water.
your lip's stopped bleeding, too, george.

you do not huh? well, you got any money?
no.
no wonder you jumped in the river.
i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings.
oh-oh. somebody is just made it.

every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
