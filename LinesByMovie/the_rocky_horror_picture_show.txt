yes.
everyone knows betty's a wonderful little cook.
yes.
and ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
yes.
yes brad.
I have got something to say.
uh huh.
i really loved the skilful way you beat the other girls to the bride's bouquet.
oh brad.
the future is ours so let's plan it.
janet.
so please do not tell me to can it.
janet.
I have one thing to say and that is dammit, janet. i love you.
oh janet
for you.
janet.
made me give you the eye and then panic,
janet
oh brad, I am mad.
dammit, janet.
gosh.  that is the third motorcyclist that is passed us.  they certainly take their lives in their hands.  what with the weather and all.
yes, janet.  life's pretty cheap to that type.
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
oh dear!  but then where did the motorcyclists come from?
hmmm ... well, i guess we will have to turn back.
what was that bang?
we must have a blow-out.
oh...
you would better sit here and keep warm while i go for help.
but where will you go?  we are in the middle of nowhere.
did not we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  maybe they have a telephone i might use.
I am coming with you.
there is no point both of us getting wet.
I am coming with you.  besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
oh, brad.  let's go back.  I am cold and I am frightened.
just a moment, janet.  they may have a telephone.
hello.
uh - oh - hi!  my name is brad majors. and this is my fiancee, janet weiss.  i - ah - wondered if you could help us.  our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  do you have a phone we might use?
you are wet.
yes, the rain has been very heavy.
yes.
i think you had better both come inside.
you are too kind.
oh brad, I am frightened.  what kind of place is this?
oh, it is probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
are you - giving a party?
no.  you have arrived on a rather special night.  it is one of the master's affairs.
oh, lucky him.
oh....say something.
say!  do any of you guys know the madison?
brad, please lets get out of here.
for god's sake keep a grip on yourself janet.
but it seems so unhealthy here.
it is just a..a party janet.
well i want to leave.
we can not go anywhere until i get to a phone.
then ask the butler - or someone.
let's wait awhile janet.  we do not want to interfere with their celebrations.
this is not the junior chamber of commerce brad.
they are probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  they may do some more folk dancing.
brad - I am cold, I am wet, and plain scared.
I am here, there is nothing to worry about.
right!
we will just say where we are then go back to the car we do not want to be any worry.
"sweet transvestite"
from transexual transylvania.
"transylvania"
so come up to the lab.
oh brad.
it is alright janet, we will play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
the master is not yet married.  nor do i think he ever will be.  we are simply his servants.
oh.
I am brad majors and this is my fiancee, janet vice.
weiss.
weiss.
do you have any tattoos brad.
certainly not!
oh well.  how about you.
brad...
it is alright janet.
and left from my dreaming was a feeling of un-nameable dread.
that am not no crime
my high is low. I am dressed up with no place to go.
oh, no no, no no.
sha la la la that am not no crime.
no no no, no no.
sha la la la that am not no crime - that am not no crime.
sha la la la that am not no crime.
oh no no no no.
sha la la la that am not no crime.
no no no no.
sha la la la that am not no crime. that am not no crime.
sha la la la that am not no crime.
no no no no.
sha la la la that am not no crime.
no no no no.
sha la la la that am not no crime - that am not no crime.
well.    i do not like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
i did not make him for you
who is eddie?
the delivery boy.
oh brad - mmmm - oh yes, my darling - what if...
it is alright janet.  everything's going to be alright.
oh, i hope so my darling.  but let me switch on the light.
no, do not do that.
oh do not be so shy.
you beast, you monster, what have you done with brad?
nothing.  why, do you think i should?
you tricked me - i would not have - I have never - never
i know.  but it was not all bad was it? in fact, i think you found it quite pleasurable. mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
ssssh.  brad's probably asleep by now. do you want him to see you like this?
like this - like how?  it is your fault. you are to blame.  i was saving myself.
well, I am sure you are not spent yet.
promise you will not tell brad.
cross my heart and hope to die.
maybe we could try it this way.
janet!  oh!  yes it is alright.  janet. everything's going to be alright.
i hope so my darling.
you!
I am afraid so, brad.  but was not it nice?
why you - what have you done with janet?
nothing.  why do you think i should?
you tricked me.  i would not have - I have never - never.
i know, but it was not all bad was it? i think you found it quite pleasurable.  oh so soft.  so sensual.
ahhh - no - stop - i mean janet.  janet.
shush.  janet's probably asleep by now. do you want her to see you like this?
like this.  like how?  it is your fault - you are to blame.  i thought it was the real thing.
oh come on, brad, admit it.  it was enjoyable, was not it?  there is no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
you promise you will not tell?
on my mother's grave.
I am engaged to brad just the same as betty monroe was to ralph hapschatt. but frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I have never dreamt of before. hot, burning kisses.
and that is all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you would thought you would known.
i could see brad's face before me and my mind screamed no!  but my lips were hungry - too hungry.
so baby do not cry like there is no tomorrow after the night there is a brand new day. and there'll be no pain and no more sorrow. so wash your face and phone my place it will be o.k.
i wanted to be loved completely. my body throbbed excitedly.  oh brad, brad my darling, how could i have done this to you?
and that is all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again. so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you have found is back again.
if only we had not made this journey. if only the car had not broken down. if only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
creature of the night.
creature of the night.
great scott - scotty - dr everett scott.
you know this earth - this person.
i most certainly do.  he happens to be an old friend of mine.
i see.  so this was not simply a chance meeting.  you came here with a purpose.
i told you, my car broke down.
i was telling the truth.
i know what you told me, brad. but this dr everett scott.  his name is not unknown to me.
he was a science teacher at denton high.
and now he works for your government, does not he, brad?  he is attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call u.f.o's.  is not he, brad?
he might be.  i do not know.
hmmmm.  he will be in the zen room.
janet!
rocky!
what a guy
makes you cry
what guy
makes you cry
it is as if we were glued to the spot.
you are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
on the day i went away.
goodbye
was all i had to say
now i
want to come again and stay
oh my, my,
smile and that will mean i may
feeling
like I am outside in the rain
wheeling
free to try and find a game
dealing
cards for sorrow, cards for pain.
great heavens, that is a laser.
yes, dr scott.  a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
good god.
yes.
i thought you liked them.  they liked you.
they did not like me.  they never liked me.
you did right.
a decision had to be made.
you are ok by me.
dr scott I am sorry about your nephew.
yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
you must leave now dr scott while it is still possible.  we are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of transylvania. go now.
our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
ah - sweet transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  to take that step to the right...
but it is the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
and our world will do the time warp again.
