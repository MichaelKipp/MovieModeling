stop that....
stop what?
that....
i'm not doing anything.
that hurt....
serves you right.  will you please stop....
can't help myself....
i see what you're doing....
i'm hungry, mom....
let me finish dinner before you eat it...chop the peppers....
are you all right?
adds flavor....
we don't want any....
hello?  thea who?  i know it's thea brody.  how many grandchildren do i have?  i know you can use the phone by yourself. you're a big girl.  i know you're five.
the fish.  check it....
you check it....
i'm on the phone....
in a minute....
what's going on?
ask the big doctor about his work.  tough life you bahamian beach bum... playing in the water all day....
he heard that.
good.
a big one....
a small one...your brother won't be here....
don't be late.
i won't....
that bad, huh?
we're out of decaf...we're out of petty cash...and we're out of requisition forms....
you have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
anything to do before i go home?
that man keeps calling about his training film.  i can't convince him we don't have a s.w.a.t. team.
good night, polly....
where's lenny?
gone to ben masters' place.  cow tipping.
cow tipping?
claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  they're not giving milk.
i'll take care of it.
deputy brody will take care of it personally.
it came for him.  it waited all this time and it came for him....
mother....
i bought him his first legal drink. he got so pissed that night....
he told me you both did....
sit down, ma....
you guys must be starving....
i want you to get out of the water....
what?
i want you to give up that terrible job.
come on, mom, you can't be serious....
you're damn right i'm serious....
i'm just getting started....
i don't want you in the water anymore....
mom, you're upset.  sit down...please....
i won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  never again...never....
hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  sharks don't commit murder. they don't pick out a person....
it picked sean...it killed your father....
dad died from a heart attack....
he died from fear...from having to go out there after it....
there's never been a great white where we live.  it's warm water... they don't like it....
your brother's dead...your father's dead....
he was such a good-natured kid... always going out of his way....
he was doing his job....
it was a piece of wood.  a shitty piece of wood.  it's not fair....
where are you going?
nowhere....
you'll spoil her.
that's what grandmas are for.
what do i think?  i think it's a lovely idea....
please, mom.  at least consider it. you should get away.  you shouldn't be alone now....
yes!
you can stay in my room.
i'd like that.  i need to be away from here.
i've always wanted to ride one of those....
no way....
chicken....
can i ride one sometime...?
it's too dangerous....
like mother, like son....
my mother always told me, if god had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
i never....
where's the lady who brings the soda?
they had them on the big one....
i have coffee in the thermos.
i'm too young for coffee.  can i drive the plane?
thea....
sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the jeep.
don't bother hoagie....
jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
good news travels fast....
i'll get it back next time.
how come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
the wind does that.  ever been to the bahamas before?
no....
first time for everything is the best.  after that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
you must get bored easily.
want to go for a little ride?
i do....
can you just go off...?
i'm the captain of this majestic ship.  it goes where i take it....
no cooking while you're here...no washing dishes...no cleaning....
i'm not on vacation....
i like grandma's cooking....
thank you....
oh, it looks like my uncle's.  he taught me how to sail when i was a kid....
it's jake's actually...our floating lab....
it sure is good to be home....
it sure is....
it'll grow on you.
i like it.  really....
it has its virtues.  it hasn't fallen down yet....
watch me, grandma....
no, no...it's too dangerous....
mommy lets me....
come on, sweetheart....
but you always let me....
not today.  come on, thea....
daddy, why can't i...?
did you hear what i said?  come inside....
i don't want to.  i want to swing....
oh, i didn't mean....  i'm being such a grandma....
come on, i'll show you around.
i didn't mean to start that....
don't be such a grandma...i was always climbing something....
you were a monkey....
all you all right?
i'm fine....
how are you doing?
okay.
we haven't had a real talk, have we? we'll do that before i go.
i'll be all right, michael.
good.  so will i....
she calls it, 'tourist on the loose.' local government commissioned it. for the public beach....
we forgot to stop at the store.
make a list.
we need milk....
big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
we need beer....
i'll be right there.
stop farting around....
stop busting my hump....
try the area around the wreck....
how many...?
will you leave me alone...?
you tagging them...?
i'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
you moved any slower, you'd grow roots...we've got a schedule...shake it, man....
the females have eggs....
we'll pass around cigars....
we're being paid to see where they go...how they propagate....
if we had some decent money, i'd be able to read their temperatures... study their motor systems....
if you'd leave me alone, i'd be able to get my work done....
michael!  this thing working?
you rigged it...you spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
michael!
i could use a half-dozen more arms ...i've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
do you and michael ever talk about his work...?  about spending so much time working in the water?
usually it's all he talks about...you mustn't worry....
i can't help it....
i used to worry...but you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
i shouldn't interfere...  my mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
henny youngman....
you caught me....
you're not interfering, ellen....
i know how to tag a damn conch....
the readings suck....
maybe it's the tags that suck....
i made them, man....
i stuck them on, man....
you didn't stick them on right....
if you made them right, it wouldn't happen...they leak....
a blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
you couldn't find your ass with both hands....
you leave me high and dry...you come back looking like a zombie....
hey!
shouldn't pick on that.  sorry.  i'm sorry about your brother....
yeah, well, just stop yelling.
i missed you, is all.  it's dull around here working alone...smelling all that sweet cologne....
put me down....
they won't fight with me....
put me down, damnit....
maybe i missed you too....
where the hell's the beer...?
your father was six then.  just like you....
i'm still five....
nothing out of the ordinary....
once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
bad boy....
i didn't do it on purpose....
you're welcome.  i was the one who cried.
was uncle sean ever bad?  did you ever spank him?
sharp shirt, jake....
may your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
listen to carla...marry me...i'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
don't flatter yourself....
only children are my favorites. that means you, magee....
my tea set.  i got my tea set.  thank you....
can i make sandwiches...?
yes, you can make sandwiches....
matt?
tell thea i'm sorry....
i don't know what the hell to say....
you don't have to say anything, matt ...i know how you feel....
yeah....
still chasing fish?
still tagging conch?
we'll be done pretty soon....
tricky little devils, aren't they? how's the degree doing?
inch by inch....
how's ellen?
she has good days and bad...i don't know....
she's a tough lady....
i wish there was something i could do....
she's had a lot to deal with...she needs time....
would you talk to her?  she's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  she still blames it for my father's death....
oh, boy....
i miss him, matt.  i still can't believe he's gone.
tell matt he should be here....
the stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
feathers all over the place....
it was like having snow in the house ...jesus, i miss them.
let me speak to ellen....
i'll get her.  have a good christmas, matt....
you too, michael....
i want you to give up your work....
mom, please don't start that again....
you could teach...you could....
i'm not going to quit now....
you're all i have left...i don't want you going in the water....
we have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...so we can swim to it....
you're silly....
you're coming, aren't you...?
who's coming?
no one.  nothing.  we've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
it's not nice to be evasive.
i don't know why i fish here...never catch anything...must be a sign under the water...'beware, hoagie's here....'
you're the man who drives the plane.
flies the plane....
mostly it feels like driving.  you digging for buried treasure?
you the architect?
i'm the artist.  like my mother.
we have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
spent it all on beer....
office of naval research has some money....
forget it....
money is money....
they put bombs on dolphins....
i know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
a regular tropo...spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  you want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  not me.  i'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
it's not a bad life, jake....
you're afraid of the competition out there....
sweet breezes...sweet women....
you have something to say about everything....
he's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
you're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  you're never going to amount to anything.
i don't know why i've told you all this.  i hardly know you.
sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
i...i can't explain it.  it's just something i feel.
i always listen to my feelings....
sometimes i think i'm going crazy. the nightmares....
it could have been an accident....
it was no accident....
i'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
when it killed sean it was like a stab in the heart.  i knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. i knew that.  i know it's coming....
what's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
the water's coming in...the water's coming in....
depends on where you want to go....
doesn't matter....
hurry!
just like that?
how can you just take the plane like this?
boss' day off...take the wheel....
i can't....
sure you can....
i don't know how....
no one does till they learn....
what are you doing?
if you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
it's just like driving a car....
where do i pull off...?
you're doing fine.  i'll keep you out of trouble.  relax....
i'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
one time i was flying supplies up the amazon.  went down in the jungle....
you're not going to tell me, are you?
got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
you're impossible....
they took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
the plane's turning....
how do you like flying?
it's wonderful....
how many?
stop busting my hump....
oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
i've struck the mother-lode.  i'm counting... spade work....
i wish you wouldn't say that....
what?
spade's a garden tool....
trouble with you, jake, is you have no sense of humor....
holy shit!
what's wrong?
nothing....
i'm fine.
no, you're not....
i'm terrific... come on....
you promised me a drink....
sharks come and go, ellen.  people don't have anything to do with it....
the kind with an umbrella in it....
give it up... kick it in the ass... get on with your life....
a drink with an umbrella in it....
a big one....
a big one....
what the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
what difference does it make?  it's here....
you guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... it's just a shark.  a great big bloody wonderful shark.  don't say anything to anyone. the locals find out they'll panic. they'll want to kill it.  we've got us a great white, michael. we're going to do us some real research....
don't say anything about this to my mother....
how much longer?  this is supposed to be your party.
in a few minutes....
you want to try your hand at something...?
i'd be afraid of losing....
couple of more passes and i'll buy my own airplane.. hell, maybe my own airline....
you're not going to bet it all....
all or nothing.  you want to roll them for me?
no!
it was theirs anyway.  i 11 buy us all a drink....
we'll buy you one.  we're having a party....
i knew there was a reason i could afford this.  to the woman of my dreams.. who grows more beautiful....
here it comes....
who grows more beautiful....
here comes the cow ca-ca....
more beautiful with each passing minute...
i told you....
now wait a minute... i'm being serious here....
oh, jake...
happy birthday, darling. ...
don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
i just want to make an honest woman of you....
i'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
at least he doesn't have a beard....
do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
she's in management....
i'm training to....
manage the whole damn place some day. i'm looking forward to living in the style to which i would like to become accustomed....
i'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
woman has taste....
when he has a pillow over his head....
you want to be careful how you talk to me... i'm about to become famous...you should see....
would you suffer through a dance with me?
you'll be sorry.
i have two right feet.
good.  i have two left....
mind if i cut in?  your date's lonely....
the world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
you're having a good time....
i am.
i enjoy his company....
i don't like him chasing around after you...i don't trust him....
he's not chasing and i'm not running. and that's ridiculous....
i'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
you're not a pain in the ass....
will you let me finish.  i've been working on this all day.
it's not easy.  none of it is.  i have to find some way to get on with my life and i'm going to try.  i finally figured that out.  i'm going to do my best....
good.
that's it?  good...i thought you'd break out the champagne....
i'm pleased.  i really am.  really....
no more sharks.  i'll stay for another week, then....
you just got here....
children are never satisfied.  i have my house, my friends, my job...my life, michael.  i have to live it. besides, i'll be back.  now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
where is everybody?
down here....
what happened to clarence and...?
gave them the day off....
what for?  we've got a job to finish ...why are you making the monitor?
as the sun slowly sets in the west, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
we're out of money, partner.. we wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... how come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  you got two of them...?
we don't write up anything until we're done....
okay.. .we're done, man....
when we got the grant....
when i got the grant.....
when i signed on....
when i invited you...
we got it together, jake....
okay...we got it together....
we have at least three months' work left.  we can't write a report...we don't know enough....
we've got a rare bird here, michael. great whites don't come to the bahamas.  there's never been one down here before.  i'm not just going to let it swim away.
my name goes on that report.  it's a half-assed job, i don't get my doctorate.  neither do you....
the shark will get it for us.
i thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
so did i....
i don't know shit about electronics....
you don't know shit about anything. time you learned....
it doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
my brain is shrinking.  there's only so much room.
don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  i'm trying to get ready for....
i thought artists worked with their subconscious....
how come it's my responsibility?
because....
i take out the garbage, because...i'm glad we got that straightened out....
we don't have anything straightened out.  you're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
why should there be anything wrong? i'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
what the hell are we arguing about?
i don't know...you...i don't know.
no fair, i'm not armed.
then don't come any closer.
turn it off....
no....
off....
i have work....
i've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  i've dreamed of nothing else since i was a small boy.
close the door.
they're at the beach....
you sure you've done this before?
lots of times....
and it's always worked?
so far..
our little island seems to agree with you....
i have my own little island.
but it gets cold in winter....
i tried winter once.  burlington, vermont.  flew a run to new york.  i have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  when i was a small boy....
that's hard to imagine....
i dreamed about always being warm... stay a while....
i could take some time off....
you're always taking time off....
i like to travel....
i'll nick the boss' plane again....
what?
i borrow it without telling him....
won't you get in trouble...?
only if he finds out... it's a short hop to the caribbean.  we could take a few days....
there must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
there are...i'm tired of one-way conversations....
i have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, ellen brody.
why?
because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  blushing suits you....
i'm sorry...i....
there's nothing to be sorry about.
the whole idea is preposterous....
you sure you don't need glasses?
my vision is perfect....
what are we getting out of this old bucket?
what she's got.  nine knots....
shit....
how long have you known hoagie?
what?
how long have you known hoagie?
what the hell does hoagie have to do with this?
how long?
as long as he's been here....
bring her to starboard.
how long has he been here...?
who?
hoagie.
i don't remember.  one day he was just here....
what do you know about him?
what's so funny about that?
you think he's not good enough for her?  you're right.  if she was my mother, i'd send her home right now.
bring her about.  we're headed in the wrong direction....
half the pilots down here fly drugs ...he's always going off....
half don't...bring her about....
i am...you must know something about him....
he gambles...he likes a good time...i see him around....
i hear he flies a lot of private charters....
we lost it....
maybe the gear crapped out....
if you hadn't been gassing about hoagie....
maybe it's gone....
all he did was kiss me....
it's beginning....
beginning of what?
whatever happens next.....
i always thought when i grew up i'd know what to do about things like this...i don't even know if he's serious....
give it some time, ellen...see what happens.
part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...i don't know why he wants me....
maybe he's got good taste...i don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
i don't know what he thinks...i don't know what i think...i don't even know why i'm talking about it...  it's silly...i'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
you said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
yes, i did.
it's time for tea, grandma.
i almost forgot....
i didn't.
i put everything in my room.  my teddy bear is joining us.
thanks for the consultation....
i'll be in to read you a story.
good night, daddy....
it's late....
trying to write our report....
you look tired....
i'm fine....
you and sean used to make....
i have to get this finished.
i'm leaving in a few days.  i don't want to do that with you unhappy....
i m not unhappy.  frustrated maybe... discouraged a little.  it'll work out....
i'm worried.. we haven't had our....
there's nothing to worry about....
i'm your mother.  it's my job....
you looked just like your father... the first time the shark came to amity....
i don't want to talk about that.
it's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
i'm tired of hearing about it. there's no shark.  sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. dad didn't die because of it...it's all wrong... some fantasy you've concocted...you keep bringing it up.
you hungry?
no.
i've got about a half dozen...i'm going to tag them.  you hearing anything?
nothing.. but stay within a quarter mile...i've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  if he comes back i'll hear him.  you'll have time to get up.
i'm coming...how close is it?
close...i don't know...just get the hell....
get the bang sticks.  we're going down.
bang sticks are like yelling at it....
we're going down.  all of us....
they won't kill it....
we'll divert it...we'll do something....
it's my turn in the barrel, man....
you fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
i don't like it....
i didn't ask you to....
what about carla's gig?
i'm going down, jake....
she's not going to like it....
i hope the man knows what he's doing....
he knows what he has to do....
you getting a reading on them?
i live to hear the sound...you all right?
what about the monitor...?  you getting anything on the shark?
nothing...hey michael...you know i was thinking about yesterday.  maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
how come only me?
maybe he only likes white meat....
funny, jake...funny.
just trying to be helpful....
a moray eel...a moray eel....
'it was so ugly...it was so big....'
'a moray eel....'
'snuck up on me....'
'it got us in hot water...we should have been there for carla....'
shit....
don't be so down, man.  money's gone...shark's gone...we're back to conch...we've got it made....
shove it....
you'll be the eternal tropo...the old man and the sea...know the words to this one?  'oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
stop that!
you don't like my voice...?
i don't like the song.
tough shit.  'when the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
you told me what?
screw you, jake....
where have you been...?
what's wrong?  what happened?
thea was attacked by a shark....
the doctor said she should be all right...she's in shock....
but it went away...we would have known....
you knew...?
it went away....
sweetheart....
she could have been killed...you knew and you didn't tell us...you let your mother think....
where is she?
how could you do that?  your own daughter....
where's my mother?
i don't know....
why didn't you tell us?  why didn't you tell us?
i'm sorry.  please, carla.  i didn't think there was any danger.  i'm sorry. i love you.  both of you.
i hope she's a good sailor....
a shark attacked thea and some kids...she's going after it....
you're going after her in that? you're crazy...it'll take all day in that bathtub....
you got a better idea...?
when we find her we'll radio her position...the coast guard will pick her up.  don't worry....
she'll be all right, partner.. she'll never find it.  we couldn't....
what do you mean, it'll find her?
she said it was coming....
i want you to leave her alone.  i don't want you involving her in....
what's that....?
what do you deliver on all those charters you...?
i fly elephants for smugglers....
can't this thing go any faster?
any faster and it'll turn into a flying cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
holy christ....
mom....
what the hell are you doing?
i've got to get to her....
you jump, you'll kill yourself....
grab your socks....
you sure you know how to do this.
hell, no.  what kind of pilot do you think i am...?
hell, that wasn't half bad.. get going...i'll keep it busy....
it'll come for the plane.  it's attracted to metal.  the electro- magnetic impulse....
will you get the bloody hell out of here....
come on, hoagie....
all you passengers are the same.... complain...complain....
it got him....
why'd you come out here?
why'd you take the boat?
i tried to tell you...i tried....
give me a hand here for christ's sake....
what say we get the hell out of here, ellen brody. ...
get her started....
maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
they spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   they don't care what it is....
if it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  we'll need a slave switch to set it off. pull the dry cell out of the radio.
anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
all the time....
it'll work....
theory, partner...if it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...confuse it...drive it away....
if we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  just like taking a picture.
the big picture...if we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
i forgot my rubber gloves.  let's do it.
your equipment has crapped out again....
my equipment doesn't crap out....
i'll do it, jake.
no way....
it's my fault...i have to....
we need it to eat electronics, man ...not you.  get it on me....
jake.
i'm the one who wanted to study it....
keep it steady....
aye, aye, captain....
what happened?
nothing!  what the hell are you doing down there?
the damn thing is going to have our asses....
it needs more time to charge.
i can't....
yes you can....
i want you all to come to amity this summer.
there's a lot...i want to talk about it....
we will...we'll have a lot of time together.  what are you going to do now?
we'll be there....
you make sure they come?
i will.  i'll miss you, grandma.
i'll miss you....
promise me you'll be all right....
promise me....
i'll wear my rubbers...i'll be careful ...i'll be....
can you keep a secret?  something no one else knows?
yes i can....
