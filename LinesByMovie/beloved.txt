no. sorry.
ah, winter in ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
they'll be all right. i'm surprised they lasted here this long.
i don't know. maybe we should have moved.
what'd be the point? not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead negro's grief. we lucky our ghost is a baby. my husband spirit come back? or yours? don't talk to me! ha..you lucky. you got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. be thankful. i had eight. eight with six fathers. every one of them gone from me. four taken, four chased and all, i expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. my first born - alls i can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. her little hands..i wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. can you beat that? eight children and that's all i remember.
you remember halle.
oh, i remember bits and pieces of all of'em i guess..halle, of course..i had halle a lifetime. almost twenty years... my two girls, sold and gone before i could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. my third child, my son after halle...i let that straw boss have me for four months so's i could keep that boy. next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. i couldn't love that child. i wouldn't. not any of the rest either. god take what he would....and he did...
the boys wouldn't have left if halle were here.
those boys didn't even know him. you had six whole years of marriage to my halle fathered every one of your children. a blessing. i learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like halle..now that's somebody.
...all i remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. her little hands...i wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
..."here. look here. see this mark? if you can't tell me by my face, look here."
back stiff?
ooh, yeah...don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
could be that fall you took.
that was fun.
should i wake her?
no, let her rest.
she likes to see you off in the morning.
i'll make sure she does. but first i'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
won't you be late for work?
don't matter. first time i'll be late in nine years. no great trouble..whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  the world is in this room, baby. this is all there is and all there needs to be.
folks came.
folks come. folks go.
here, let me carry that.
i got a delivery around here. name of tucker.
yonder. twin chestnuts in the yard.
well?
well what?
this saturday - you coming to call or what?
if i call them, and they come what on earth am i going to say to them.
say the word!
the word. what you was put here to speak.
that's the last thing they took from me.
but you got to do it. you got to. can't nobody call like you. you have to be there.
what i have to do is get in my bed and lay down. i want to fix on something harmless in this world.
what world are you talking about? ain't nothing harmless down here.
blue. that doesn't hurt nobody. yellow neither.
you getting into bed to think about yellow?
i likes yellow.
then what? when you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
can't say. it's something can't be planned.
you blaming god. that what you're doing?
no, stamp. i ain't.
you saying whitefolks won. that what you saying?
those white things have taken all i had or dreamed. i'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..they just don't know when to stop.
you saying nothing counts?
i'm saying they came into my yard.
you saying god give up? nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
i'm saying they came into my yard.
you punishing him, ain't you?
not like he punished me.
you can't do that, baby. it ain't right.
was a time i knew what was.
you still know.
what i know is what i see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
aw, baby.
we have to be steady. "these things too will pass". what you looking for? a miracle?
no. i'm looking for what i was put here to look for: the back door.
what the hell you thinking, girl? strolling in here this late?
don't talk to me, mr. sawyer. don't say nothing to me this morning.
what? what? you talking back to me?
i'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
not too sweet! you make it too sweet they don't eat it.
make it the way i always do.
yeah. too sweet.
where you been keeping yourself? i told john must be cold if stamp stay inside.
oh i been out.
out where?
was over to baby suggs.
what you want there? somebody invite you in?
that's baby's kin. i don't need no invite to look after her people.
somebody new there. a woman. thought you might know who she is.
ain't no new negroes in this town i don't know about. what she look like? you sure that wasn't denver?
i know denver.
you sure?
i know what i see.
might see anything at all at 124.
true.
better ask paul d.
can't locate him.
he's sleeping in the church.
the church!
yeah. asked rev. pike if he could stay in the cellar.
it's cold as charity in there! what he do that for? any number'll take him in.
can't nobody read minds long distance. all he have to do is ask somebody.
why? why he have to ask? can't nobody offer? what's going on? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
unrile yourself, stamp. it's only a few days he been there.
no! shouldn't be no days! you know all about it and don't give him a hand? that don't sound like you, ella. me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! a working man who can pay his own way?
he ask, i give him anything.
why's that necessary all of a sudden?
i don't know him that well.
you know he's colored? what else there to know?
stamp, don't tear me up this morning! i don't feel like it.
it's her, ain't it?
her who?
sethe. he took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
hold on! don't jump if you can't see bottom!
girl, give it up! we been friends too long to act like this.
well, who can tell what went on in there? i never even knew who sethe was or none of her people.
you know she married baby suggs' boy.
i ain't sure i know that. baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. and how'd she make it and her husband didn't? and where is he? and how she have that baby in the woods by herself? said a whitewoman help her. shoot. you believe that? well, i know what kind of white that was.
aw, no, ella.
anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the lord tells me i don't want no part of.
you was friends.
till she showed herself.
ella.
i ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
what's any of that got to do with paul d.?
what run him off? tell me that!
i run him off.
you?
i told him...showed him the newspaper. about sethe. read it to him. he left that very day.
you didn't tell me that. i thought he already knew.
he didn't know nothing. and nobody. except her, from when they was at that place baby suggs was at.
he knew baby suggs?
sure he knew her. her boy halle, too.
and he left when he found out what sethe did?  what you say casts a different light on it, i guess...i thought-
but you didn't come here talking 'bout paul. you came asking about a new girl.
that's so.
well, paul d. must know who she is. or what she is.
you mind loaded with spirits. everywhere you look you see one.
you know as well as i do, stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
..i swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her. me and her waited for our daddy. i love her. i do. she never hurt me. i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, i'm scared of her because of it. all the time, i'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... i have to keep it away from my sister...i'll protect beloved...'cause she's mine...
beloved..she's mine       i am beloved
and she is mine...
did you come from the other side.
yes. i was on the other side.
you came back because of me?
yes.
you never forgot me?
your face is mine.
don't love her too much.
do you forgive me?
you hurt me.
i will protect you.
will you stay?
why did you leave me who am you?
i will never leave you again.
watch out for her; she can give you dreams.
where are the men without skin?
the whitefolk?
out there. way off.
daddy is coming for us.
can they get in here?
no. they tried once but i stopped them. they won't ever come back...you my best thing.
this is hard for me. but i got to do it. two things i got to say to you. i'm a take the easy one first.
if it's hard for you, might kill me dead.
i come looking for you to ask your pardon. apologize.
for what?
you pick any house, any house where colored live. pick any one and you welcome to stay there. i'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. but you welcome anywhere you want to be. my house. john and ella. miss lady jones..anybody. you choose. you ain't got to sleep in no cellar and i apologize for each and every night.
well i...i did get offered one place but i just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
oh yeah. oh that's load off. i thought everybody gone crazy.
just me.
you planning to do anything about it?
oh yeah. i got big plans.
hey!!
yes sir.
i'm looking for a gal name of judy. works over by the slaughterhouse. said she lived on plank road.
plank road. yes sir. that's up a ways. mile, maybe.
you don't know her? judy? works in the slaughterhouse.
no sir, i don't, but i know plank road. 'bout a mile up thataway.
look here..there's a cross up there, so i guess this here's a church or used to be. seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
yes sir..you right about that. that's just what i come over to talk to him about. just that..
you remember your price, stamp?
never found out.
i did. down to the cent.$900. always wondered though what mrs. garner got for my brother paul f. must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost two years. but then they hung my other brother paul a. up on a tree so i guess he wasn't worth the same..i wonder what was baby suggs worth? and halle? i wasn't surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti. her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. a breeder.
no use thinking these things now.
oh but we got to. how we gonna know our price in the future? how are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? who's gonna tell them? what are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
they'll know. they'll know as soon as they born. cause it's inside us,stamp. it'll be inside them. we'll pass it down. schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
i don't believe that. i won't.
there was a rooster named mister down at sweet home. last time i saw halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, i saw mister - sitting on a tub. he loved that tub. like king on a throne. he was a hateful thing. bloody and evil..but he was better than me.  mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named mister. but wasn't no way i'd ever be paul d. again..schoolteacher changed me. was never no beating under mr. garner. schoolteacher changed that. why wouldn't a man run from that? why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? and it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
i said i had two things to say to you. i only told you one. i have to tell you the other.
i don't want to know.
i was there paul d...there in the yard. when she did it.
what yard? when who-
jesus.
it ain't what you think.
you don't know what i think.
she ain't crazy. she love those children. she was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
leave off..
she was only-
stamp, leave off i said! i knew her when she was a girl. she scares me and i knew her when she was a girl...
you ain't scared of sethe. i don't believe you.
she scares me. i scare me. and that girl in her house scares me.
who is she? where she come from?
don't know. just shot up one day from a stump.
she what run you off? not what i told you 'bout sethe?
tell me something, stamp. tell me this one thing. how much is a nigger supposed to take?
all he can. all he can.
why? why? why? why? why?
what do you know about it? i sleep where i want.
you best leave that quilt alone. that was grandma's quilt.
morning.
morning, ma'am.
you don't sit with me!!
baby, don't be like that.
you don't sit with me!! i don't sit with people who leave me!
don't talk like that. your mama loves you.
i had another dream last night.  the dead man laying on top of me and i had nothing to eat. and the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
don't say those things. you forget about those dreams..
you gave me the bad dreams. you left me behind...
mama told you - i'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...my children my best thing. you my best thing!
you're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
that's not true. i told you, i had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
mama!
hold back denver - i'm fine..you..you go on upstairs. i'll do the cleaning up.
but mama..
go upstairs i said!!
i want somethin' sweet.
we don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
not for me, you don't! you don't let me eat the pies...
no. since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
why you never go back to lady jone's and learn your letters? you liked going there i remember. seeing the other children. then all a sudden, you stop.
there was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
you got to go sometime. you got to go out there by yourself sometime.
but you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. no de-fense.
there ain't.
then what do i do?
know it, and go on out the yard. go on.
mama let me help you.
no!...she wanted me to do it.
i want to work, miss lady.
work? start learnin your letters again?
no. i mean work work.
well, what can you do?
i can't do anything but i would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
extra?
food. my mama, she doesn't feel well. i couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but i could do chores in the mornings.
oh baby...i don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...but if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...we have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
no..no that won't do...
nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..i don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. i refuse..that's right..that's right...
mama...mama she's asleep. why don't you eat something.
she likes this dress...
but you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. come sit at the table.
yes?
may i come in?
what you want?
i want to see mr. and mrs. bodwin.
miss bodwin. they brother and sister, darlin.
oh.
what you want'em for?
i'm looking for work. i was thinking they might know of some.
you baby sugg's kin, ain't you?
yes ma'am.
i heard your mother took sick, that so?
yes ma'am..
well, come on in. you letting in flies.
you know what? i've been here since i was fourteen and i remember like yesterday when baby suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. whiteman name of garner brought her. he and mr. bodwin were good friends. that's how she got that house you all live in. other things too.
yes ma'am.
i never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. always. never be another like her.
i miss her.
bet you do. everybody miss her. that was a good woman...well, i don't know whether the bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
ya think?
they getting older now and i can't take care of 'em like i used to. more and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. now, i don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. i got my own family needs me. it'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
fine. but what would i do at night?
be here. in case.
in case of what?
in case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad i can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. anything.  don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
they good whitefolks?
oh yeah. they good. can't say they ain't good. i wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. but you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. all right?
no...no...no..
mama?
well, is it now? how you getting along?
don't pay to complain.
you on your way home?
no. got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. figure between that and my night work at the bodwins i might be able to put something away for me and mama.
they treating you right over at the bodwins?
more than all right. miss bodwin, she teach me stuff..book stuff. she says i might go to oberlin. she's experimenting on me.
your mother all right?
no. not a bit all right. hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
you think i should stop by? think she'd welcome it?
i don't know. i think i've lost my mother, paul d.
that girl...you know, beloved...
yes?
she gone like they say?
haven't seen her since that day. ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..i don't think so. mama thinks she's gone for good. says she can feel it.
you think she sure 'nough your sister?
at times. at other times i think she was...more. but who would know that better than you. i mean, you sure 'nough you her.
well, if you want my opinion...
i don't. i have my own.
you grown.
yes sir
well, good luck with the job.
thank you.
and paul d...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
i will.

she left me. she's gone again.
aw, girl. don't cry...me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. we need some kind of tomorrow...
she was my best thing.
