no. sorry.
ah, winter in ohio is especially rough if you have got an appetite for color.
they will be all right. I am surprised they lasted here this long.
i do not know. maybe we should have moved.
what did be the point? not a house in the country am not packed to the rafters with some dead negro's grief. we lucky our ghost is a baby. my husband spirit come back? or yours? do not talk to me! ha..you lucky. you got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. be thankful. i had eight. eight with six fathers. every one of them gone from me. four taken, four chased and all, i expect, worrying somebody is house into evil. my first born - alls i can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. her little hands..i would not know'em if they slapped me. can you beat that? eight children and that is all i remember.
you remember halle.
oh, i remember bits and pieces of all of'em i guess..halle, of course..i had halle a lifetime. almost twenty years... my two girls, sold and gone before i could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. my third child, my son after halle...i let that straw boss have me for four months so's i could keep that boy. next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. i could not love that child. i wouldn't. not any of the rest either. god take what he would....and he did...
the boys would not have left if halle were here.
those boys did not even know him. you had six whole years of marriage to my halle fathered every one of your children. a blessing. i learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like halle..now that is somebody.
...all i remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. her little hands...i would not know 'em if they slapped me".
..."here. look here. see this mark? if you can not tell me by my face, look here."
back stiff?
ooh, yeah...don't know if it is the floor or the skating.
could be that fall you took.
that was fun.
should i wake her?
no, let her rest.
she likes to see you off in the morning.
I will make sure she does. but first I am going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.

you still know.
what i know is what i see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
aw, baby.
we have to be steady. "these things too will pass". what you looking for? a miracle?
no. I am looking for what i was put here to look for: the back door.
what the hell you thinking, girl? strolling in here this late?

what? what? you talking back to me?
I am telling you do not say nothing to me.

yeah. too sweet.
where you been keeping yourself? i told john must be cold if stamp stay inside.
oh i been out.

i know denver.
you sure?
i know what i see.

true.
better ask paul d.
can not locate him.
he is sleeping in the church.
the church!
yeah. asked rev. pike if he could stay in the cellar.
it is cold as charity in there! what he do that for? any number'll take him in.
can not nobody read minds long distance. all he have to do is ask somebody.
why? why he have to ask? can not nobody offer? what is going on? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
unrile yourself, stamp. it is only a few days he been there.
no! should not be no days! you know all about it and do not give him a hand? that do not sound like you, ella. me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! now you tell me you can not offer a man a bed?! a working man who can pay his own way?
he ask, i give him anything.
why is that necessary all of a sudden?
i do not know him that well.
you know he is colored? what else there to know?
stamp, do not tear me up this morning! i do not feel like it.
it is her, am not it?
her who?
sethe. he took up with her and stayed in there and you do not want nothing to-
hold on! do not jump if you can not see bottom!
girl, give it up! we been friends too long to act like this.
well, who can tell what went on in there? i never even knew who sethe was or none of her people.
you know she married baby suggs' boy.
i am not sure i know that. baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. and how did she make it and her husband didn't? and where is he? and how she have that baby in the woods by herself? said a whitewoman help her. shoot. you believe that? well, i know what kind of white that was.
aw, no, ella.
anything white floating around in the woods - if it do not got a shotgun, it is something the lord tells me i do not want no part of.
you was friends.
till she showed herself.
ella.
i am not got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
what is any of that got to do with paul d.?
what run him off? tell me that!
i run him off.
you?
i told him...showed him the newspaper. about sethe. read it to him. he left that very day.
you did not tell me that. i thought he already knew.
he did not know nothing. and nobody. except her, from when they was at that place baby suggs was at.
he knew baby suggs?
sure he knew her. her boy halle, too.
and he left when he found out what sethe did?  what you say casts a different light on it, i guess...i thought-
but you did not come here talking 'bout paul. you came asking about a new girl.
that is so.
well, paul d. must know who she is. or what she is.
you mind loaded with spirits. everywhere you look you see one.
you know as well as i do, stamp, that people who die bad do not stay in the ground.
..i swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her. me and her waited for our daddy. i love her. i do. she never hurt me. i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I am scared of her because of it. all the time, I am afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it can not happen again ... i have to keep it away from my sister...i'll protect beloved...'cause she is mine...
beloved..she's mine       i am beloved
and she is mine...
did you come from the other side.
yes. i was on the other side.
you came back because of me?
yes.
you never forgot me?
your face is mine.
do not love her too much.
do you forgive me?
you hurt me.
i will protect you.
will you stay?
why did you leave me who am you?
i will never leave you again.
watch out for her; she can give you dreams.
where are the men without skin?
the whitefolk?
out there. way off.
daddy is coming for us.
can they get in here?
no. they tried once but i stopped them. they will not ever come back...you my best thing.
this is hard for me. but i got to do it. two things i got to say to you. I am a take the easy one first.
if it is hard for you, might kill me dead.
i come looking for you to ask your pardon. apologize.
for what?
you pick any house, any house where colored live. pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I am apologizing 'cause they did not offer to tell you. but you welcome anywhere you want to be. my house. john and ella. miss lady jones..anybody. you choose. you am not got to sleep in no cellar and i apologize for each and every night.
well i...i did get offered one place but i just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
oh yeah. oh that is load off. i thought everybody gone crazy.
just me.
you planning to do anything about it?
oh yeah. i got big plans.
hey!!
yes sir.
I am looking for a gal name of judy. works over by the slaughterhouse. said she lived on plank road.
plank road. yes sir. that is up a ways. mile, maybe.
you do not know her? judy? works in the slaughterhouse.
no sir, i don't, but i know plank road. 'bout a mile up thataway.
look here..there's a cross up there, so i guess this here's a church or used to be. seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
yes sir..you right about that. that is just what i come over to talk to him about. just that..
you remember your price, stamp?
never found out.
i did. down to the cent.$900. always wondered though what mrs. garner got for my brother paul f. must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost two years. but then they hung my other brother paul a. up on a tree so i guess he was not worth the same..i wonder what was baby suggs worth? and halle? i was not surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti. her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. a breeder.
no use thinking these things now.
oh but we got to. how we going to know our price in the future? how are children's children's children going to know what they cost? who is going to tell them? what are they going to pay for us, if we free?
children am not going to need to know that kind of thing.
they will know. they will know as soon as they born. cause it is inside us,stamp. it will be inside them. we will pass it down. schoolteacher did not just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it is worth..
i do not believe that. i won't.
there was a rooster named mister down at sweet home. last time i saw halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, i saw mister - sitting on a tub. he loved that tub. like king on a throne. he was a hateful thing. bloody and evil..but he was better than me.  mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. even if you cooked him you would be cooking a rooster named mister. but was not no way I would ever be paul d. again..schoolteacher changed me. was never no beating under mr. garner. schoolteacher changed that. why would not a man run from that? why would not a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? and it strikes me, it is got to be cause we were something else. and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
i said i had two things to say to you. i only told you one. i have to tell you the other.
i do not want to know.
i was there paul d...there in the yard. when she did it.
what yard? when who-
jesus.
it am not what you think.
you do not know what i think.
she am not crazy. she love those children. she was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
leave off..
she was only-
stamp, leave off i said! i knew her when she was a girl. she scares me and i knew her when she was a girl...
you am not scared of sethe. i do not believe you.
she scares me. i scare me. and that girl in her house scares me.
who is she? where she come from?
do not know. just shot up one day from a stump.
she what run you off? not what i told you 'bout sethe?
tell me something, stamp. tell me this one thing. how much is a nigger supposed to take?
all he can. all he can.
why? why? why? why? why?
what do you know about it? i sleep where i want.
you best leave that quilt alone. that was grandma's quilt.
morning.
morning, ma'am.
you do not sit with me!!
baby, do not be like that.
you do not sit with me!! i do not sit with people who leave me!
do not talk like that. your mama loves you.
i had another dream last night.  the dead man laying on top of me and i had nothing to eat. and the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
do not say those things. you forget about those dreams..
you gave me the bad dreams. you left me behind...
mama told you - I would give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...my children my best thing. you my best thing!
you are were not nice to me..you did not smile at me..
that is not true. i told you, i had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
mama!
hold back denver - I am fine..you..you go on upstairs. I will do the cleaning up.
but mama..

i want somethin' sweet.
we do not have nothing sweet no more, baby.
not for me, you don't! you do not let me eat the pies...
no. since mama lost her job, we do not have no more pies..
why you never go back to lady jone's and learn your letters? you liked going there i remember. seeing the other children. then all a sudden, you stop.
there was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
you got to go sometime. you got to go out there by yourself sometime.
but you said...you said out there, there am not no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. no de-fense.

i want to work, miss lady.
work? start learnin your letters again?
no. i mean work work.
well, what can you do?
i can not do anything but i would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
extra?
food. my mama, she does not feel well. i could not stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but i could do chores in the mornings.
oh baby...i do not know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...but if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...we have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
no..no that will not do...
nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..i do not care..ain't laying that down..no sir. i refuse..that's right..that's right...
mama...mama she is asleep. why do not you eat something.

but you will hurt your eyes doin it there. come sit at the table.
yes?

they getting older now and i can not take care of 'em like i used to. more and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. now, i do not want to quit these people but they can not have all my days and nights too. i got my own family needs me. it will take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how is that?
fine. but what would i do at night?
be here. in case.
in case of what?
in case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad i can not get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. anything.  do not ask me what whitefolks need at night.

i do not know. i think I have lost my mother, paul d.
that girl...you know, beloved...
yes?
she gone like they say?
have not seen her since that day. ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..i do not think so. mama thinks she is gone for good. says she can feel it.
you think she sure 'nough your sister?
at times. at other times i think she was...more. but who would know that better than you. i mean, you sure 'nough you her.
well, if you want my opinion...
