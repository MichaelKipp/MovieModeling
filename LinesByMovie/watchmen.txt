had a lot of blood in him.
you oughta see upstairs.  it is a slaughterhouse.
no idea who is behind this?
small army, from the looks of it.  he put up one hell of a fight.
he would -- you might as well know.  it is going to get messy.  we got a call from washington.
washington?
they want in.  seems our friend here was hardcore ctu.
hiya, pardner.  long time no see.
did anybody follow you?  see you come here?
sure.  you got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
human bean juice.  the comedian is dead.
so do i.  so do you.
rorschach, that was a long time ago.  i mean, that -- that is just paranoia.
maybe.  or maybe somebody is finally caught up with us.  somebody with a grudge.  thought you might want to spread the word.
hey.  hey.  if you do not mind, use the back stairs, all right?
the comedian.  he is dead.  murdered.  that is all i know.
my god.  murdered?  -- what is this have to do with rorschach?
it is -- he is got some kind of conspiracy theory.  he thinks someone is . . . i do not know, stalking us.
us.  you mean the watchmen.
i know, i know, it is just -- he is back on the street, he smells blood.
you know how he is.  he goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he is satisfied.  it blows over.
he is bound to get caught.  i do not want my name coming out.  not at this late date.
if he comes here, I will handle him.  remember -- I have always protected you.  have not i?  do you need money?
no.  i just wanted you to --
you did the right thing, daniel.  let's stay in touch, okay?  good night.
good night.
adrian.
laurie!  good to see you.
do not rub it in.  i live here.
and how is life with the walking h-bomb?
he is in by the superaccelerator.  -- let me take your coat.
hi, jon.
hello, adrian.
the bearer of bad news.
we have lost a colleague.  the comedian is dead.
blake?  dead?
yes.  i heard this morning.  washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
rorschach's on the case.  he is got dreiberg in a lather.  he seems to think that someone is "stalking" the watchmen.
oh?  the ctu suspects a libyan hit squad.
what is your theory?
life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  they do not concern me.
i guess you will be dismantling russian tanks soon.
you mean afghanistan?  it will not require my attention.  what I am doing here is far more interesting.
adrian!  do not leave so soon.  i --
I will take a raincheck, laurie.
please.
he is a little farther gone every time.
stay, adrian.  i just -- every once in a while, i need to talk to someone human.  he does not think like we do.  he does not even feel what we feel.  i mean -- he even scares the research teams.
laurie -- he is the most powerful man who is ever lived.  he is changed the world.
i know.  i should not be saying this.  he is happy, he is content, he is doing his work --
what about you?
i suppose I am serving my purpose, are not i.  I will ring for the guards.
nasty cough.  -- try one of mine.  darling, you need to get out of the house.  why do not you give daniel a call?  I am sure he would be glad to hear from you.
maybe I will do that.
I am sorry about blake.
I am here, laurie.
is it time?  d'you have to leave for the funeral?
not yet, there is plenty of time.
would you like me to stay?
mm hmm.
i could stay and go.
. . . and just how would you manage that?
sorry, it is this thing with blake.  i mean, you do not really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
dan, are you really that paranoid?  let's face it, eddie blake was no mother teresa.
psychotic pig.  he had it coming.  mr. ctu . . .
now wait.  we all had the same option as blake.  it was work for the government or do time.
fine, but the civil terrorism unit?  it is a fucking gestapo!  dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
okay, okay.  you made your choice.  you went underground.  some of us made other choices.

damn straight.
damn straight!  we were heroes.
of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
well, that was adrian's idea.  i know he is the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
hey.  you remember that nut in the hockey mask?  with the asthma? what was his name . . .
oh yeah.  the one that used to confess to everything?  hoping we would beat him up?
that is the one.  whatever happened to him?
he pulled it on rorschach . . . and rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
major adamson, i can not seem to get in the door.
laurie, I will have to ask you to come with me.
why?  what is the problem?
i can not tell you that.  it is quite urgent.
i would like to use the bathroom --
the access code's been changed.  your card will not work anymore.
what?!
please.
their real names, please.
i do not know their real names.
you are lying, miss juspeczyk.
i do not know their real names!
you are not "protecting" anyone.  these people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  these are all former associates of dr. manhattan --
then why do not you ask him?!?
sit down, miss juspeczyk.  as i mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of dr. manhattan.  they have something else in common as well.  they have all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
what are you saying?  that jon is radioactive?
I am terribly sorry.
what does this mean?  what does it --
six to eight months.  that is with treatment.  -- perhaps now you can see why it is so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
that is it.  this is all a trick, is not it?  some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I will say.  if we ever get off this looney-tune project, I am going to head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
with lots of ketchup?
nothing wrong with ketchup.
jon osterman, you do not act like a princeton boy.  what is a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
anything for science, i guess.  janey, there is something --
we should get back --  what?
nothing.  what were you going to say?
we should get back to the lab.  you okay, jon?
stupid watch.  stopped again.  do you have the --
janey, will you marry me?
i can fix it.
-- what?
my dad's a watchmaker.  I will put it back together for you.  better than ever.
all right, miss juspeczyk.  pack your things.
am i free to go?
you are free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  let's move it.
i do not know why you have been keeping me here, but you are in deep shit --
oh, i am, honey.  you see, russian tanks are crossing the afghan border this very minute.  and we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
jon??  you mean he is --
that is right.  your meal ticket's flown the coop.  that blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
i do not know who you are buddy, but i swear to god, you got the wrong guy.
edgar william jacobi, aka william edgar bright, a.k.a. moloch.
you are making a big --
terrorist.  radical agitator.  stool pigeon.
all right!  all right!!  -- how did you find me?
rorschach, you are talkin' heavy duty stuff.  i got nothing to do with --
worked both sides of the fence.  ask your old buddies in the ctu.
ctu?  jesus.  you do not think --
do not know.  ask around.  I will be back.
what about our end?
well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we would assume that twenty-five percent of the russian birds get through.
what kind of time frame are we talking about?
thirty minutes maximum.  of course, i assume we would be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
as you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
what about the aftermath?  this so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
we do not really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
the weather.  i see.  keep me posted.  i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
christ yes, i went in for a cancer scan first thing.  gave me a couple of rough nights, I will tell you . . .  how about you, laurie?
oh, yeah.  they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  no expense account.  no place to live.
you will find something.  -- i should go.  you and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
they are not following me, dan.  i mean -- jon's gone, we are right on the brink of world war iii.  nobody cares about the watchmen.
maybe not, but why take chances?
dan, what are you so scared of?  i mean, me, I have spent all these years keeping jon together, and now that it is over i feel -- i feel glad.  I am finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
laurie, wait.  I have got a spare room.  it is empty.  if you would like . . . laurie oh daniel, thanks, but i couldn't.  you would just be all nervous about --
no, screw that.  what you were saying before, it is absolutely right.  -- I would love to have you stay.
you are sure?
oh.  no.  sorry.  I will be right down the hall if you want me . . . i mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I am going to take a warm bath and sack out.  -- you have been really sweet.  sleep tight, okay?
two things i hate.  street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
no, no.  you got it all wrong.  i been on the case, rorschach, i got something for you.
sphinx brand.  when i got out of weapons design, i wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  i was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  and i thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only does not cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  in fact i think I will have one now.  care to join me?
thanks, no.  but it is a wonderful product.  now adrian -- your old colleague dr. manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
no.  no.  cut.  -- justine, we agreed.  no questions about the watchmen.
oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
no.  we laid out very careful ground rules --
new information.
ever see one of these before?
too important for telephone.  comedian -- dr. manhattan.  all linked up.
what is that ungodly smell?
bigger than i thought.  ctu involved . . .
yeah, I have heard all about your conspiracy theories.  now I have got a roomful of cameras in there.  i want you out.  now.  and whatever you are doing, knock it off.  you are making us all look bad.
fate of the world at stake, adrian.  can not get too worked up over bad press.
his what?
his . . . whatever.
I am not his . . . whatever.  okay?
i told you i was a little bit out of step.  a lot of the old stuff i listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I would say you stalled out about forty years ago.  nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- I have never even heard of these people.
play one.  educate yourself.
no wonder adrian's rich.  you use that stuff?
sure.  it works.  i mean, look at this face, daniel.  I am thirty-eight years old!
i do not mind getting older.  I am obsolete anyway.  why try to hide it?
i like the way you look.  it is strange with jon.  he does not age.  his face does not change. but you, daniel, you look . . .
old?
not at all.  you look very -- dashing.  here, you pick one.
. . . what?
pick a record.  i feel like dancing.
eight cops?  oh, great.  a jury's going to love that.
are you kidding?  if they put him in jail he is dead.  he will never get to trial.
i just realized.  I would never seen his face.  i guess it was just a matter of time.  he is totally -- daniel? what is wrong?
the comedian . . . jon . . . now rorschach.
walter --
do not call me that.
walter -- you are just telling me what you think i want to hear.
wrong answers?
there is no right or wrong.  but if you do not give me an honest response, i can not help you.  i want to help you.  i want to know all about you.
hnnrr.  -- like to masturbate.  shit once a day.
no comment.
did you know he was back on the streets?
i did not.  now get out of my way!
is not it true that you --
who?
i do not know, but . . . in the wake of all that is happened, I am starting to think rorschach may have been right.  is laurie okay?
she is with me.
good.  be careful, daniel, do not let up your guard.  look, I am going to head south for a while -- hole up at karnak until all this blows over.  you two would be welcome to join me.
thanks for the offer, adrian.  I will let you know.
ohh.  i could use some dinner.  who was that on the phone?
one more down.  someone tried to kill adrian.  . . . first time I have ever heard him scared.
-- what is it.
i know what you are thinking.  you would be a lot safer if i were not around.
laurie --
I am an open target, dan.  if you are with me --
with any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
a whore fucking.
who is she?  do you know her?
and what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
why, doctor.  i did.  he was a bad dog.
walter.  this compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  in your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
god is not there to do it.
we do not know that.
that man, then, he was the first.  the first you --
saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  god did not make it that way.  we did.  we make the world -- in our own image.  what else can i illuminate?
enough is enough, daniel.  where exactly are we?
memory lane.
the owlship.  i can not believe it.
-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
i took her out a couple of summers back.  scared the hell out of some cows.  -- i wonder if she would make it down to antarctica.
antarctica??
adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  he invited us to come along.  I have been thinking.  if things do get nasty . . . it would not be a bad place to sit out a war.
would you want to sit out a war?  i mean -- what would be left.
you and me.
dan!  the spare costumes!  i can not believe you kept them.
me neither.  mine barely even fits.  the thing is, i try to remember why we did it, and i can't.  helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . i do not know.  it all seems so abstract.
god, you sound like jon.  -- turn around.
what are you up to?
do not look.  turn around.
this'd better not be what i think it is.
okay!
what the hell -- ?
it is a peace rally.  the ctu's just opened fire on the crowd.
oh, laurie.  jesus.  no.
they are following us.
all right.  mission accomplished.
missed 'em dan.  you are aiming high!
i do not want to take 'em out.  just want to keep 'em interested.
they are practically on us . . .
that detroit shit?  I am so worried.
what?
the costumes.  am i right?
no way.  I am not that much of a pervert.
yes you are.
no offense, laurie, but it was silk spectre i had the crush on.  tonight was the first time I have felt like myself in ten years.
that is because --
it is because there is nothing to be afraid of anymore.  the world's about to end.  i feel like i could save it.
you are full of yourself.  what are you doing?
long as we are on the subject of perverts . . .  i miss rorschach.  let's spring him.
. . . what??
what is he doing?
i think he is going to the john.
my god!  we bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
. . . that was quick.
toilet clogged.  short fat turd.  let's get out of here.
i do not know if you heard.  a hired gunman tried to off adrian.
veidt's a fool.  tried to warn him about new information.  sicced his mangy cat on me.
what new information?
blake investigating missing scientists for ctu.  dr. manhattan somehow involved . . .
i beg your pardon . . . ?  some gratitude.
will you two lovebirds keep it down?
welcome back, night owl.
what now?  fly south -- hook up with adrian?
ctu.  could be behind dr. manhattan frame-up.
what do you mean, frame-up?
obvious pattern -- all ties in --
are you saying that someone would risk starting world war iii just to get back at us?  what about all those poor shits with cancer?
how do we know they have got cancer?  could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
come on, rorschach.  gimme a break --
I am not here.  I am still on mars.  I have come to collect you.
collect me?
in the immediate future we are on mars.  I am telling you goodbye. you are trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
jon, no -- i can not --
it will happen, laurie.  I have already seen it.  neither of us can do anything to change it.
where is laurie?
i do not think she is coming with us.
the atmosphere.  I am sorry.  these things slip my mind.
jesus, jon, i nearly choked to -- where are we --
we are running, rorschach.  we have got no place to go.  we are hightailing it down to adrian's.
veidt's assassin.  leads to follow.  can not just --
cases, leads -- they do not matter, rorschach.  the world's about to end.  if someone is trying to kill us, it does not matter.
coward.  giving up.
shut up, rorschach.
sorry, daniel.  you have always been a good friend.  i know that.  sorry about laurie.
okay, let's just . . . thank you.
this whole place is ticking.  does it -- keep time?
yes.  in about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you will tell me you are sleeping with dreiberg.
you -- you know about me and dan?
jon, does anybody know what the hell you are talking about?  dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  when he looks at me he is seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
then you are sleeping with dreiberg?
well, i just, you just said -- do not act surprised.
that is how time works, laurie.  everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  we are all puppets.  I am just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- thirty seconds.
jon -- there is something i have to know.  did you love me once?
yes, i loved you.  i left the earth when i lost you.
yet you must have known all along that you would give me cancer.  just be being with me.
i did not give you cancer, laurie.  not you, not the others.  i do not know what did.
but you knew that I would -- die.
memories of the future are just like any others.  I have tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  you will not die of cancer, laurie.  there will not be time for that.
then it is going to happen.  the world's going to end.  -- and you have always known.
always.  ever since the day i died.
then why do not you . . . do something about it!
because --
because you can't, i know, it is preordained.  so sorry.  i forgot.  jon.  this, this "script" you are following . . . who writes it?
i do not know yet.  i should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
i can not stand any more of this.  i want to go back.  if I am going to die i want to be with -- other people.
please, laurie.  not yet.  I have got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I will be alone.  you are the last human being I will ever see.
what happened?
the guidance system's fried.  i had to switch to manual.  -- some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
what caused it?
do not know.  nothing i can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
adrian.  what are you doing?  why would not you let us in?
he is the one.  he is been the one all along.  stalking us.
adrian -- you?  you killed blake, and --
yeah.  see, I have been working on a little project.  top secret, of course . . .
the missing scientists.
uh huh.  you might recognize the names.  quite a few of them worked at gila flats.
gila flats -- place where jon turned into . . .
dr. manhattan, right.  now if you boys care to join me, we will go save the world.
what??
i could not let him interfere with my project.
veidt.  you are the one who started world war iii.
no.  i just hastened the inevitable.  he is been ready to blow for years.  i knew all it would take was a little push.  so i, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
call off the cat and I will kill you, veidt.
before you do that, you might want to look at what I have been looking at.
it is  jon.  twenty-four years ago.  before he turned into dr. manhattan.
good lord.  how did you get it on tape?
it is not on tape.  it is live.  we are watching it happen.
jon, i do not want to hear it.
I am sorry.  look -- there is a gas storm on the valles marineris . . .
oh god.  I am no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
you are the only human being i care for.
then do me a favor.  if the world's going to end, it should not matter a bit.  i want you to cure me.
i will not do that.
you have the power to do it.  i want you to do it.  please.
i explained this.  i can't.  that is not the way it happens.
jon.  if you ever loved me -- if there is anything human left in you -- then do it.
what -- am i --
cured, yes.
gentlemen, the past.  unfolding before your eyes.  stand back from the field.  it will blow you to bits.
what is it?  how does it work?
it is a tachyon chamber.  it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  there are other worlds, daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
adrian -- you have lost it.
I have seen them!  I have seen them in there.
its very strange.  times flowing backwards . . .
jon -- what??
the south pole.  times flowing backwards.
. . . and they call me a fucking nut.
adrian.  its too late.  the world is blowing up as we stand here.
dont be obtuse, daniel.  if i kill jon in the past, none of this will happen.  we wont even be here, will we?
and what if youre wrong?
im not.
what if youre wrong??
then ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  christ!  im doing what i have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
jon, where are we?
veidts complex.
your problem, dan, is a lack of vision.  you spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  as if any of it mattered.
you ruthless son of a bitch.  you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
we would better hope so.  -- it is almost time.
what are you doing, veidt?
jon!  get back!  you do not understand.
what was he doing?
trying to change the past.  he said it was the only way to save the world --
jon --
space and time.  i finally understand, laurie.  i see it all now.
jon -- for gods sake, what do you see?
i see what the watchmaker made.  i see the universe!
he saved himself.  he changed the past.
where did he go?
dan, is this -- is this new york??
those cars.  what year is this??
everything's changed --
dan -- what do we do now?
wherever we are, it is better than what we left.  backs together --
we will tell them what is happened.  they will listen to reason, will not they -- ?
