had a lot of blood in him.
you oughta see upstairs.  it's a slaughterhouse.
no idea who's behind this?
small army, from the looks of it.  he put up one hell of a fight.
he would -- you might as well know.  it's gonna get messy.  we got a call from washington.
washington?
they want in.  seems our friend here was hardcore ctu.
hiya, pardner.  long time no see.
did anybody follow you?  see you come here?
sure.  you got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
human bean juice.  the comedian is dead.
so do i.  so do you.
rorschach, that was a long time ago.  i mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
maybe.  or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  somebody with a grudge.  thought you might want to spread the word.
hey.  hey.  if you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
the comedian.  he's dead.  murdered.  that's all i know.
my god.  murdered?  -- what's this have to do with rorschach?
it's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  he thinks someone's . . . i don't know, stalking us.
us.  you mean the watchmen.
i know, i know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
you know how he is.  he goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  it blows over.
he's bound to get caught.  i don't want my name coming out.  not at this late date.
if he comes here, i'll handle him.  remember -- i've always protected you.  haven't i?  do you need money?
no.  i just wanted you to --
you did the right thing, daniel.  let's stay in touch, okay?  good night.
good night.
adrian.
laurie!  good to see you.
don't rub it in.  i live here.
and how's life with the walking h-bomb?
he's in by the superaccelerator.  -- let me take your coat.
hi, jon.
hello, adrian.
the bearer of bad news.
we've lost a colleague.  the comedian is dead.
blake?  dead?
yes.  i heard this morning.  washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
rorschach's on the case.  he's got dreiberg in a lather.  he seems to think that someone is "stalking" the watchmen.
oh?  the ctu suspects a libyan hit squad.
what's your theory?
life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  they don't concern me.
i guess you'll be dismantling russian tanks soon.
you mean afghanistan?  it won't require my attention.  what i'm doing here is far more interesting.
adrian!  don't leave so soon.  i --
i'll take a raincheck, laurie.
please.
he's a little farther gone every time.
stay, adrian.  i just -- every once in a while, i need to talk to someone human.  he doesn't think like we do.  he doesn't even feel what we feel.  i mean -- he even scares the research teams.
laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  he's changed the world.
i know.  i shouldn't be saying this.  he's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
what about you?
i suppose i'm serving my purpose, aren't i.  i'll ring for the guards.
nasty cough.  -- try one of mine.  darling, you need to get out of the house.  why don't you give daniel a call?  i'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
maybe i'll do that.
i'm sorry about blake.
i'm here, laurie.
is it time?  d'you have to leave for the funeral?
not yet, there's plenty of time.
would you like me to stay?
mm hmm.
i could stay and go.
. . . and just how would you manage that?
sorry, it's this thing with blake.  i mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
dan, are you really that paranoid?  let's face it, eddie blake was no mother teresa.
psychotic pig.  he had it coming.  mr. ctu . . .
now wait.  we all had the same option as blake.  it was work for the government or do time.
fine, but the civil terrorism unit?  it's a fucking gestapo!  dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
okay, okay.  you made your choice.  you went underground.  some of us made other choices.

damn straight.
damn straight!  we were heroes.
of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
well, that was adrian's idea.  i know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
hey.  you remember that nut in the hockey mask?  with the asthma? what was his name . . .
oh yeah.  the one that used to confess to everything?  hoping we'd beat him up?
that's the one.  whatever happened to him?
he pulled it on rorschach . . . and rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
major adamson, i can't seem to get in the door.
laurie, i'll have to ask you to come with me.
why?  what's the problem?
i can't tell you that.  it is quite urgent.
i would like to use the bathroom --
the access code's been changed.  your card won't work anymore.
what?!
please.
their real names, please.
i don't know their real names.
you're lying, miss juspeczyk.
i don't know their real names!
you're not "protecting" anyone.  these people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  these are all former associates of dr. manhattan --
then why don't you ask him?!?
sit down, miss juspeczyk.  as i mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of dr. manhattan.  they have something else in common as well.  they've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
what are you saying?  that jon is radioactive?
i'm terribly sorry.
what does this mean?  what does it --
six to eight months.  that's with treatment.  -- perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
that's it.  this is all a trick, isn't it?  some kind of horrible joke to make me --
i'll say.  if we ever get off this looney-tune project, i'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
with lots of ketchup?
nothing wrong with ketchup.
jon osterman, you don't act like a princeton boy.  what's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
anything for science, i guess.  janey, there's something --
we should get back --  what?
nothing.  what were you going to say?
we should get back to the lab.  you okay, jon?
stupid watch.  stopped again.  do you have the --
janey, will you marry me?
i can fix it.
-- what?
my dad's a watchmaker.  i'll put it back together for you.  better than ever.
all right, miss juspeczyk.  pack your things.
am i free to go?
you're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  let's move it.
i don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
oh, i am, honey.  you see, russian tanks are crossing the afghan border this very minute.  and we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
jon??  you mean he's --
that's right.  your meal ticket's flown the coop.  that blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
i don't know who you are buddy, but i swear to god, you got the wrong guy.
edgar william jacobi, aka william edgar bright, a.k.a. moloch.
you're making a big --
terrorist.  radical agitator.  stool pigeon.
all right!  all right!!  -- how'd you find me?
rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  i got nothing to do with --
worked both sides of the fence.  ask your old buddies in the ctu.
ctu?  jesus.  you don't think --
don't know.  ask around.  i'll be back.
what about our end?
well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the russian birds get through.
what kind of time frame are we talking about?
thirty minutes maximum.  of course, i assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
as you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
what about the aftermath?  this so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
we don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
the weather.  i see.  keep me posted.  i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
christ yes, i went in for a cancer scan first thing.  gave me a couple of rough nights, i'll tell you . . .  how about you, laurie?
oh, yeah.  they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  no expense account.  no place to live.
you'll find something.  -- i should go.  you and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
they're not following me, dan.  i mean -- jon's gone, we're right on the brink of world war iii.  nobody cares about the watchmen.
maybe not, but why take chances?
dan, what are you so scared of?  i mean, me, i've spent all these years keeping jon together, and now that it's over i feel -- i feel glad.  i'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
laurie, wait.  i've got a spare room.  it's empty.  if you'd like . . . laurie oh daniel, thanks, but i couldn't.  you'd just be all nervous about --
no, screw that.  what you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- i'd love to have you stay.
you're sure?
oh.  no.  sorry.  i'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . i mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
i'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- you've been really sweet.  sleep tight, okay?
two things i hate.  street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
no, no.  you got it all wrong.  i been on the case, rorschach, i got something for you.
sphinx brand.  when i got out of weapons design, i wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  i was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  and i thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  in fact i think i'll have one now.  care to join me?
thanks, no.  but it's a wonderful product.  now adrian -- your old colleague dr. manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
no.  no.  cut.  -- justine, we agreed.  no questions about the watchmen.
oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
no.  we laid out very careful ground rules --
new information.
ever see one of these before?
too important for telephone.  comedian -- dr. manhattan.  all linked up.
what is that ungodly smell?
bigger than i thought.  ctu involved . . .
yeah, i've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  now i've got a roomful of cameras in there.  i want you out.  now.  and whatever you're doing, knock it off.  you're making us all look bad.
fate of the world at stake, adrian.  can't get too worked up over bad press.
his what?
his . . . whatever.
i'm not his . . . whatever.  okay?
i told you i was a little bit out of step.  a lot of the old stuff i listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
i'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- i've never even heard of these people.
play one.  educate yourself.
no wonder adrian's rich.  you use that stuff?
sure.  it works.  i mean, look at this face, daniel.  i'm thirty-eight years old!
i don't mind getting older.  i'm obsolete anyway.  why try to hide it?
i like the way you look.  it's strange with jon.  he doesn't age.  his face doesn't change. but you, daniel, you look . . .
old?
not at all.  you look very -- dashing.  here, you pick one.
. . . what?
pick a record.  i feel like dancing.
eight cops?  oh, great.  a jury's gonna love that.
are you kidding?  if they put him in jail he's dead.  he'll never get to trial.
i just realized.  i'd never seen his face.  i guess it was just a matter of time.  he's totally -- daniel? what's wrong?
the comedian . . . jon . . . now rorschach.
walter --
don't call me that.
walter -- you're just telling me what you think i want to hear.
wrong answers?
there's no right or wrong.  but if you don't give me an honest response, i can't help you.  i want to help you.  i want to know all about you.
hnnrr.  -- like to masturbate.  shit once a day.
no comment.
did you know he was back on the streets?
i did not.  now get out of my way!
isn't it true that you --
who?
i don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, i'm starting to think rorschach may have been right.  is laurie okay?
she's with me.
good.  be careful, daniel, don't let up your guard.  look, i'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at karnak until all this blows over.  you two would be welcome to join me.
thanks for the offer, adrian.  i'll let you know.
ohh.  i could use some dinner.  who was that on the phone?
one more down.  someone tried to kill adrian.  . . . first time i've ever heard him scared.
-- what is it.
i know what you're thinking.  you'd be a lot safer if i weren't around.
laurie --
i'm an open target, dan.  if you're with me --
with any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
a whore fucking.
who is she?  do you know her?
and what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
why, doctor.  i did.  he was a bad dog.
walter.  this compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  in your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
god isn't there to do it.
we don't know that.
that man, then, he was the first.  the first you --
saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  god didn't make it that way.  we did.  we make the world -- in our own image.  what else can i illuminate?
enough is enough, daniel.  where exactly are we?
memory lane.
the owlship.  i can't believe it.
-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
i took her out a couple of summers back.  scared the hell out of some cows.  -- i wonder if she'd make it down to antarctica.
antarctica??
adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  he invited us to come along.  i've been thinking.  if things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
would you want to sit out a war?  i mean -- what would be left.
you and me.
dan!  the spare costumes!  i can't believe you kept them.
me neither.  mine barely even fits.  the thing is, i try to remember why we did it, and i can't.  helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . i don't know.  it all seems so abstract.
god, you sound like jon.  -- turn around.
what are you up to?
don't look.  turn around.
this'd better not be what i think it is.
okay!
what the hell -- ?
it's a peace rally.  the ctu's just opened fire on the crowd.
oh, laurie.  jesus.  no.
they're following us.
all right.  mission accomplished.
missed 'em dan.  you're aiming high!
i don't want to take 'em out.  just want to keep 'em interested.
they're practically on us . . .
that detroit shit?  i'm so worried.
what?
the costumes.  am i right?
no way.  i'm not that much of a pervert.
yes you are.
no offense, laurie, but it was silk spectre i had the crush on.  tonight was the first time i've felt like myself in ten years.
that's because --
it's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  the world's about to end.  i feel like i could save it.
you're full of yourself.  what are you doing?
long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  i miss rorschach.  let's spring him.
. . . what??
what's he doing?
i think he's going to the john.
my god!  we bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
. . . that was quick.
toilet clogged.  short fat turd.  let's get out of here.
i don't know if you heard.  a hired gunman tried to off adrian.
veidt's a fool.  tried to warn him about new information.  sicced his mangy cat on me.
what new information?
blake investigating missing scientists for ctu.  dr. manhattan somehow involved . . .
i beg your pardon . . . ?  some gratitude.
will you two lovebirds keep it down?
welcome back, night owl.
what now?  fly south -- hook up with adrian?
ctu.  could be behind dr. manhattan frame-up.
what do you mean, frame-up?
obvious pattern -- all ties in --
are you saying that someone would risk starting world war iii just to get back at us?  what about all those poor shits with cancer?
how do we know they've got cancer?  could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
come on, rorschach.  gimme a break --
i'm not here.  i'm still on mars.  i've come to collect you.
collect me?
in the immediate future we're on mars.  i'm telling you goodbye. you're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
jon, no -- i can't --
it will happen, laurie.  i've already seen it.  neither of us can do anything to change it.
where's laurie?
i don't think she's coming with us.
the atmosphere.  i'm sorry.  these things slip my mind.
jesus, jon, i nearly choked to -- where are we --
we're running, rorschach.  we've got no place to go.  we're hightailing it down to adrian's.
veidt's assassin.  leads to follow.  can't just --
cases, leads -- they don't matter, rorschach.  the world's about to end.  if someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
coward.  giving up.
shut up, rorschach.
sorry, daniel.  you've always been a good friend.  i know that.  sorry about laurie.
okay, let's just . . . thank you.
this whole place is ticking.  does it -- keep time?
yes.  in about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with dreiberg.
you -- you know about me and dan?
jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  when he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
then you're sleeping with dreiberg?
well, i just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
that's how time works, laurie.  everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  we're all puppets.  i'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- thirty seconds.
jon -- there's something i have to know.  did you love me once?
yes, i loved you.  i left the earth when i lost you.
yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  just be being with me.
i didn't give you cancer, laurie.  not you, not the others.  i don't know what did.
but you knew that i'd -- die.
memories of the future are just like any others.  i've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  you won't die of cancer, laurie.  there won't be time for that.
then it's going to happen.  the world's going to end.  -- and you've always known.
always.  ever since the day i died.
then why don't you . . . do something about it!
because --
because you can't, i know, it's preordained.  so sorry.  i forgot.  jon.  this, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
i don't know yet.  i should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
i can't stand any more of this.  i want to go back.  if i'm going to die i want to be with -- other people.
please, laurie.  not yet.  i've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  i'll be alone.  you're the last human being i'll ever see.
what happened?
the guidance system's fried.  i had to switch to manual.  -- some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
what caused it?
don't know.  nothing i can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
adrian.  what are you doing?  why wouldn't you let us in?
he's the one.  he's been the one all along.  stalking us.
adrian -- you?  you killed blake, and --
yeah.  see, i've been working on a little project.  top secret, of course . . .
the missing scientists.
uh huh.  you might recognize the names.  quite a few of them worked at gila flats.
gila flats -- place where jon turned into . . .
dr. manhattan, right.  now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
what??
i couldn't let him interfere with my project.
veidt.  you're the one who started world war iii.
no.  i just hastened the inevitable.  he's been ready to blow for years.  i knew all it would take was a little push.  so i, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
call off the cat and i'll kill you, veidt.
before you do that, you might want to look at what i've been looking at.
it is  jon.  twenty-four years ago.  before he turned into dr. manhattan.
good lord.  how'd you get it on tape?
it's not on tape.  it's live.  we're watching it happen.
jon, i do not want to hear it.
i'm sorry.  look -- there's a gas storm on the valles marineris . . .
oh god.  i'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
you're the only human being i care for.
then do me a favor.  if the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  i want you to cure me.
i won't do that.
you have the power to do it.  i want you to do it.  please.
i explained this.  i can't.  that's not the way it happens.
jon.  if you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
what -- am i --
cured, yes.
gentlemen, the past.  unfolding before your eyes.  stand back from the field.  it'll blow you to bits.
what is it?  how does it work?
it's a tachyon chamber.  it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  there are other worlds, daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
adrian -- you've lost it.
i've seen them!  i've seen them in there.
its very strange.  times flowing backwards . . .
jon -- what??
the south pole.  times flowing backwards.
. . . and they call me a fucking nut.
adrian.  its too late.  the world is blowing up as we stand here.
dont be obtuse, daniel.  if i kill jon in the past, none of this will happen.  we wont even be here, will we?
and what if youre wrong?
im not.
what if youre wrong??
then ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  christ!  im doing what i have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
jon, where are we?
veidts complex.
your problem, dan, is a lack of vision.  you spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  as if any of it mattered.
you ruthless son of a bitch.  you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
we'd better hope so.  -- it's almost time.
what are you doing, veidt?
jon!  get back!  you don't understand.
what was he doing?
trying to change the past.  he said it was the only way to save the world --
jon --
space and time.  i finally understand, laurie.  i see it all now.
jon -- for gods sake, what do you see?
i see what the watchmaker made.  i see the universe!
he saved himself.  he changed the past.
where did he go?
dan, is this -- is this new york??
those cars.  what year is this??
everything's changed --
dan -- what do we do now?
wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  backs together --
we'll tell them what's happened.  they'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
