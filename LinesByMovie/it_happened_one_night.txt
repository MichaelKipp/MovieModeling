on a hunger strike, huh?  when'd she eat last?
she has not had a thing yesterdayor today.
been sending her meals in regularly?
yessir. she refuses them all.
why did not you jam it down her throat?
it is not quite that simple.  I have dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
absurd!  all this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I am going down to see her myself.
what is this about not eating?
i do not want to eat!  and there is one more thing i do not want! definitely! that is to see you.
know what my next move is? no more cigarettes.
why do not you put me in chains?
i might.
all right! put me in chains! do anything you want!  but I am not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
come on, ellie. stop being silly. you know I am going to have my way.
i will not stand for it! i will not stand for your running my life! why do you insist on it!
you ought to know why. because
yes. i know.  because I am your daughter and you love me. because you do not want me to make any mistakes. because
because marrying that fool king westley is
you are wasting your time. I am already married to him.
not so far as I am concerned, you are not.  yes?
smart, are not you! so subtle.
if gandhi had a chef like paul, it would change the whole political situation in india.
you can not tempt me.  do you hear? i will not eat!
please. i can not fight on an empty stomach. remember what napoleon said.
i hope you are not comparing yourself to napoleon. he was a strategist. your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
where are you taking me?
south america.
south america!
we leave miami in an hour. soon's we get some supplies aboard.
you will have a corpse on your hands! that what you will have. i will not eat a thing while I am on this boat.
in that event, we will not need so many supplies.
what do you expect to accomplish by all this? I am already married!
I will get it annulled.
you will never do it! you can not do it!
I will do it if it takes every penny I have got. I will do it if i have to bribe that musical comedy justice of the peace! I will do itif i have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. you probably were.  mmmmmm. this filet mignon is divine!
what have you got against king westley?
nothing much. i just think he is a fake, that is all.
you only met him once .
that was enough. do you mind handing me the ketchup?
you talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
never mindi'll get it myself.  gigolo? why, you took the word right out of my mouth. thanks.
he is one of the best fliers in the country. right now he is planning a trip to japan.
you are going to finance him, i suppose.
why not?  look what he is doing for aviation. it takes courage to do what he does. and character! at least he is accomplished something worthwhile. i suppose you would like to have me marry a business man. well, i hate business menparticularly if you are a shining example.
your whole life is devoted to just one thing. to accumulate more money. at least there is romance in what he is doing.
he is no good, ellie, and you know it. you married him only because i told you not to.
you have been telling me what not to do since i was old enough to remember.  I am sick of it!
a time will come when you will thank me for this.
i will not thank you! I will never thank you!
please do not shout.
I will shout to my heart's content! I will scream if i want to.
ah! coconut layer cake. nice and gooey, too. just the way i like it.
it is my daughter! go after her.
lower the boats!
what a hell cat. no controlling these modern girls.  they are terrible!
terrible! nothing terrible about her. she is great! marvelous youngster! got a mind of her own. knows just what she wants.  she is not going to get it though. she will not get very far. has no money.
what about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
holy smoke! i forgot all about that.  send a wireless at once, "lovington detective agency. daughter escaped again. watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in miami. have your new york office keep tabs on king westley. intercept all messages. want her back at all costs!"
here's your ticket, ma'am.
oh, thank you. thank you very much.  here.
oh, thank you. thank you.
when does the bus leave?
in about fifteen minutes.
thank you.
say, listen, you would not know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  yeah?  sure, sure, i got your copy. why did not you tell me you were going to write it in greek? I would start a new department.
that was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
free verse, huh?  what the dickens was free about it? it cost this paper a gob of dough. well, I am here to tell you, it is not going to cost us any more.
that is okay by me! 'cause as far as I am concerned, I am through with newspapers! see? I am through with stupidity! I will never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if i have to starve.  yeah? what about my novel! when i get through with that
when you get through with that, I will have a beard down to my ankles.
mr. gordon
huh?
did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
what!  say, listen you!  when you get back to new york, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you do not care what happens to that funny map of yours.
whadda you want!
if you will be good enough to remove those newspapers I will have a seat.
okay! okay! keep your shirt on, young feller.
just between you and me, i never intended taking it off.
what do you think you are doing!
huh?
the papers! the papers! whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
ohthe papers
that is a long story, my friend. you see, i do not like sitting on newspapers. i did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
oh, i would not kid you . on the level, it actually happened. nobody bought a paper that day. they followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
what are you going to do about the papers? somebody is got to pick 'em up.
it is okay with me. I am not arguing.
fresh guy, huh! what you need is a good sock on the nose.
look here, partner. you may not like my nose. but i do. it is a good nose. the only one I have got. i always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. if you decide to do it, make sure you do not miss.
oh, yeah?
now, that is a brilliant answer. why did not i think of it? our conversation could have been over long ago.
oh, yeah?
you win!
i beg your pardon!
now, listen. I am in a very ugly mood. i put up a stiff battle for that seat. so if it is just the same to you  scram.
driver!
driver!
yeah?
these seats accommodate two passengers, do not they?
maybe they doand maybe they don't.
tell that man not to drive so fast.
are you talking to me?
yes. tell that man to drive slowly.
i do not know what you are raving about, young man. and, furthermore, I am not interested.
wellof all thewell  maybe you will be interested to know your bag's gone.
oh, my heavens! it is gone!
yeah. i knew you would catch on eventually.
what happened?
that cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. boy, how that baby can run!
what am i going to do now?
do not tell me your ticket was in it?
no, I have got that, all right. but my money. all i have here is four dollars. I have got to get to new york with it.
you can wire home for some money when we get to jacksonville.
why, noi  yes . . . i guess i will.
I will report it to the driver. about your bag, i mean.
no. I would rather you didn't.
do not be a fool. you lost your bag. the company'll make good. what is your name?
i do not want it reported!
why, that is ridiculous! they are responsible for everything that
see here, can you understand english! i do not want it reported!  please stay out of my affairs!  i want to be left alone.  a close-up of peter shows him glaring after her.
why, you ungrateful brat!
oh, thank you.  we are in jacksonville, are not we?
yes.
that was foolish of me. why did not you shove me away?
i hated to wake you up.  how about some breakfast?
no, thank you.  thank you so much.
where is the bus to new york?
left twenty minutes ago.
why, that is ridiculous! i was on that busi told them to wait!
sorry, miss. it is gone.  ellie's face clouds. the crowds surge about her. she looks around thoughtfully. suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the view then moves over to peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward ellie.
remember me? I am the fellow you slept on last night.
seems to me I have already thanked you for that.  what time is the next bus to new york?
eight of the clock tonight.
eight o'clock! why, that is twelve hours!
sorry, miss.
what is the matter? would not the old meanies wait for you?  say, how old are you anyway? do not you know these busses work on a schedule? you need a guardian.
what are you excited about? you missed the bus, too.
do not tell me you did it on my account!  hope you are not getting any idea that what happened last night is  you need not concern yourself about me, young man. i can take care of myself.
you are doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  here's your ticket.
my ticket?
i found it on the seat.
oh, thank you. must have fallen out of my pocket.
you will never get away with it, miss andrews.
what are you talking about?
just a spoiled brat of a rich man. you and westley'll make an ideal team.
will you please tell me what you are raving about!
you will never get away with it, miss andrews. your father'll stop you before you get half way to new york.
you must have me confused with
quit kidding!  it is all over the front pages, you know, I have always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry king westley.
take my advicegrab the first bus back to miami. that guy's a phony.
i did not ask for your advice.
that is right. you didn't.
you are not going to notify my father, are you?
what for?
if you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
i never thought of that.
listen, if you will promise not to do it, I will pay you. I will pay you as much as he will. you will not gain anything by giving me away as long as I am willing to make it worth your while. I have got to get to new york without being stopped. it is terribly important to me. I would pay now, only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes. I will give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york.
never mind. you know i had you pegged right from the start, you are the spoiled brat of a rich father. the only way you can get anything is to buy it. now you are in a jam and all you can think of is your money. it never fails, does it? ever hear of the word "humility"? no, you wouldn't. i guess it never occurred to you to just say, "please mister, I am in trouble. will you help me?" no; that would bring you down off your high horse for a minute. let me tell you something; maybe it would take a load off your mind. you do not have to worry about me. I am not interested in your money or your problems. you, king westley, your father, you are all a lot of hooey to me.
you send telegrams here?
I am just fine thanks, and how are you?  to "joe gordon, care of new york mail, new york. am i laughing. the biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. i know where ellen andrews is"  no, do you really?
go on. go on send the telegram.
"how would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
mush. mush.
"tub of mush. well try and get it. what i said about never writing another line for you still goes. are you burning? peter warne." well, that will be $2.60.
send it collect.
collect?
collect.
you made no mistake sitting next to me.  just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this am not nothing to write home to the wife about. you got to be awful careful who you hit up with, is what i always say, and you can not be too particular, neither. once when i was comin' through north carolina, i got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. one of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. kinda struck my fancy. you know how it is. well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a mack truck. i was just warming up when she is yanked offa the bus. who do you think she was? huh? might as well give up. the girl bandit! the one the papers been writin' about.  yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a mack truck.  what is the matter, sister? you am not sayin' much.
seems to me you are doing excellently without any assistance.
that is pretty good . . . well, shut my big nasty mouth!
but i do not go in for that kinda stuffmuch. i like to pick my fillies. take you, for instance. you are my type. no kiddin' sister. i could go for you in a big way. "fun-on-the-side shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
well, you are two up on me now.
hey, you!
huh?
there is a seat over there for you.
what is the idea?
I would like to sit with myuhwifeif you do not mind.
wife?
yeah. come oncome on!
oh, excuse me.  i was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
if you promise not to snap my head off, I would like to thank you.
forget it. i did not do it for you. his voice got on my nerves.
here, boy!
what did you do? wire one of your friends for money?
no. it would be useless. father'd get the wire before they would.
never mind, son. she does not want it.
but the lady says
of course i do. what do you mean
beat it!
you have your nerve!  here, boy!
a dollar sixty! . . . you had four dollars last night! how do you expect to get to new york at the rate you are going?
that is none of your business.
you are on a budget from now on.
now, just a minuteyou can not
shut up!
what is up?
bridge washed outaround dawson.
any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
yeah? where?
up yonder. see the lights?
yeah.
that is it. dyke's auto camp.
thanks.
hey, brat!  the view moves to the rear door of the bus. ellie stands on the bottom step.
are you talking to me!
yeah. come onwe're stopping here for the night.
darn clever, these armenians.
yeah. yeah, it is a gift.
i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
oh, i forgot to tell you. i registered as mr. and mrs.
oh, you did? what am i expected to doleap for joy?
i kind of half expected you to thank me.
your ego is colossal.
yeah. yeah, not bad. how is your's?
compared to you, my friend, shapeley's an amateur.  whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! you are positively the most conceited
hey, wait a minute!  let's get something straightened out right now. if you have any peculiar ideas that I am interested in you, forget it. you are just a headline to me.
a headline? you are not a newspaper man, are you?
chalk up one for your side. now listen, you want to get to king westley, do not you?  all right, I am here to help you. what i want is your story, exclusive. a day-to- day account. all about your mad flight to happiness. i need that story. just between you and me I have got to have it.
now is not that just too cute? there is a brain behind that face of yours, is not there? you have got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
this?  oh, that is a matter of simple mathematics. these cabins cost two bucks a night and I am very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse will not stand for our having separate establishments.
well, thank you. thank you very much, but you have been very kind.
oh, yeah? it is all right with me. go on out in the storm, but I am going to follow you, see?  yeah. and if you get tough I will just have to turn you over to your old man right now. savvy?  now that is my whole plot in a nutshell. a simple story for simple people. now if you behave yourself, I will see that you get to king westley; if not, I will just have to spill the beans to papa. now which of these beds do you prefer? this one? all right.
that, i suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
oh, this?i like privacy when i retire. I am very delicate in that respect. prying eyes annoy me.  behold the walls of jericho![4] maybe not as thick as the ones that joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. you see, i have no trumpet.  now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I will give you my best pair of pajamas.
do you mind joining the israelites?
you are not really serious about this, are you?
all right, do not join the israelites. perhaps you are interested in how a man undresses.  funny thing about that. quite a study in psychology. no two men do it alike.
i have an idiosyncrasy all my own. you will notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. but that is where I am different.  go for the shoes first. after that i
smart aleck!
do you mind putting out the light?
not at all.
do you mind taking those things off the walls of jericho?  it is tough enough as it is.
oh, excuse me.
oh, by the waywhat's your name?
what is that?
who are you?
who, me?  why, I am the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I am the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
you have got a name, have not you?
yeah. i got a name. peter warne.
peter warne? i do not like it.
do not let it bother you. you are giving it back to me in the morning.
pleased to meet you, mr. warne ...
the pleasure is all mine.
I have been thinking about you.
yes?
you have had a pretty tough break at that. twice a missus and still unkissed.
I will bet you are in an awful hurry to get back to new york, are not you?
goodnight, mr. warne.
the old man's screwy!
what is 'at?
i said, the old man's screwy!
yeah!
the dame's too smart for him.
how did you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
here's another wire, sir. this one's from charleston.  "checking every northbound train. also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. no success yet. will continue to do everything possible." signed: lovington detective agency, charleston.
any others?
yessir.  there is a report here from every state along the east coast. want to hear them?
what do they say?
they are practically all the same, sir.
amateurs!
they are the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
heyyou not up yet? come oncome on!
what time is it?
eight o'clock.
here
what is it?  why, it is a toothbrush! thanks.  youyou had it pressed.
come on! hurry up! breakfast'll be ready in no time.
why, you sweet thing, you. where did you get it pressed?
listen, brati'm going to count to ten. if you are not out of bed by then I am going to yank you out myself.
onetwothreefourfive
why, you bully. i believe you would.
sixseveneightnine
I am out! I am out!
you will find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage.
outside!
certainly, outside. all the best homes have 'em outside.
i can not go out like this.
like what?
like this. i have no robe.
heretake mine.
where did you say the showersand thingswere?
heyyou're little, are not you?
where is the shower?
your hair's cute like that. you should never comb it.
I will find it myself.
hey, what is this? wearing papa's things? now that is cute. that is what i call real lovey-dovey. yessir.
if you do not get out of here, I will slap that fresh mouth of yours.
sorryi did not mean to
get out!
okay. i was just trying to make conversation.
high time you got back.
i met some very interesting women at the showers. we got to chatting about this and that. you know how time files.
very outspoken, too. said i looked funny. was not that cute?
hurry up and get dressed.
why, peter! do not you want to hear about our lovely friends?
if you did not waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
well, i hope you are not going to dictate whom i can talk to.
i know a couple of truck drivers I would like to have you meet sometime.  come on, sit down.
thank you.  my, my! scrambled eggs.
egg. one eggdoughnutsblack coffee. that is your ration till lunch. any complaints?
nope. no complaints.
I would have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
why, you do not have to apologize, mr. warne. you will never know how much i appreciate all this.
what makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
must be the spring.
i thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
he apologized for last night.  said he did not know we were married.
just shows you how wrong a guy can be. doughnut?
thanks.  you think this whole business is silly, do not you? i mean running away and everything.
no. no. it is too good a story.
yes, you do. you think I am a fool and a spoiled brat. perhaps i am, although i do not see how i can be. people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. i never have. on the contrary, I have always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. would you believe it? this is the first time I have ever been alone with a man!
yeah?
it is a wonder I am not panic stricken.
um. you are doing all right.
thanks. nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. oh, it is been a lot of fun.
one consolation; you can never be lonesome.
it has its moments. it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. ii did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. it was swell. i felt absolutely immoral. but it did not last long. they caught up with me in a department store. i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw. guess who was in it?
santa claus?
kingking westley was in it.
oh. is that how you met him?
um-hm. we rode around all afternoon. father was frantic. by 6 of the clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
aw, now, do not you start telling me i should not dunk.
of course you shouldn't. you do not know how to do it. dunking's an art. do not let it soak so long. a dip and plop, into your mouth. if you let it soak so long, it will get soft and fall off. it is all a matter of timing. i ought to write a book about it.
thanks, professor.
just goes to show you. twenty millions and you do not know how to dunk.
I would change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
detectives!
that is father at work, what will i do?  peter, what will i do?
do not look at me. i did not marry king westley.
maybe i could jump out of the window.  do you think they would see me?
come here, you little fool!
yeah. i got a letter from aunt betty. she says if we do not stop over at wilkes-barre she will never forgive us.
what are you talking about?
there is a man here to see you, sweetheart.
whome?  want to see me?
do not get excited, peter. they just asked a civil question.
there you go again! how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument?
well, you do not have to lose your temper!
you do not have to lose your temper!  that is what you told me the last time too. every time i step in to protect you. at the elk's dance[7] when that big swede made a pass at you
he did not make a pass at me! i told you a million times!
oh, so now i was drunk!
well, you were!
I am sorry i did not take another sock at him.
yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
aw, nuts! you are just like your old man!  once a plumber always a plumber! there is not an ounce of brains in your whole family!
peter warne, you have gone far enough. i will not stand being insulted like this another minute.
say, you were pretty good. jumping in like that. got a brain, have not you?
you were not so bad yourself.
we could start a two-person stock company. if things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. we will call this one "the great deception."[8]
next week "east lynne."
after that "the three musketeers."  I would make a great d'artagnan.
how about cinderellaor a real hot love story?
no mushy stuff. I am running this troupe.
oh, you are! who made you the manager?
i did! it was my idea, was not it?
you always want to run everything.
if you do not like it, you can resign from the company.
i refuse to resign!
then I will fire you. I will do all the parts myself.
here's another wire from peter warne.
throw it in the basket.  what is it say?  "have i got a story! it is getting hotter and hotter. hope you are the same."
collect?
yes.
do not accept any more.
we can not do the impossible, mr. andrews.
what I am asking is not impossible. my daughter is somewhere between here and miami. i want her found!
I have put extra men on, all along the way.
it is not enough!  are you certain she is not with king westley?
no. he is been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. he can not even get a phone call we do not know about.
I am worried, lovington. after all, something might have happened to her.
i better go over and see her.
do not be silly. nothing you can do. must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
yes.
we am not ate nothin' since yestidday.
what happened to your money?
ma spent it all for the tickets. she did not know it was going to be so much.  we shouldn'a come, i guess, but ma said there is a job waitin' for her in new yorkand if we did not go, she might lose it.
going without food is bad business, son. why did not you ask somebody?
i was going to do it, but ma would not let me. she was ashamed, i guess.
me? forget it, son.  i got millions.
thanks.
that storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
holy smokes! you will never get out yourself! better phone for some help.
phone for help?  we are right in the middle of nowhere. there is not a town within ten miles of here.
what is up?
looks like we are going to be stuck for a long time.
say, buddy
travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what is goin' on in the world.
thanks.
if you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what i always say.
that is right.
take that story there, for instance. be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
yeahwouldn't it?
it is a lotta dough. if i was to run across that dame, you know what I would do?
what?
I would go fifty-fifty with you .
why?
cause I am a guy that do not believe in hoggin' it, see?  a bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what i always say.
what is on your mind?
five g'sor i crab the works.
you are a pretty shrewd baby.  we better get away from this gang. talk this thing over privately.
lucky thing, my running into you. just the man i need.
you are not making any mistake, believe you me.
i can use a smart guy like you.
say listen, when you are talkin' to old man shapeley, you are talking to
do you pack a gat?[11] a close view of the two shows the smile dying on shapeley's face. he looks up quickly.
huh?
a gat! a gat!  got any fireworks on you?
whyno
that is all right. i got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I will let you have one of them.
yeahthe "big boy"the boss of the outfit.
you are not kidnapping her, are you?
what else, stupid! you do not think we are after that penny-ante reward, do you?  ten thousand bucks? chicken feed! we are holding her for a million smackers.
say, look! i did not know it was anything like this, seeand
what is the matter with you! gettin' yellow?
but I am a married man. i got a couple of kids. i can not get mixed up with
sh-sh-sh! soft pedal, you mug!before i what are you trying to do? tell the whole world about it!  now listen, you are in this thingand you are staying in! get me? you know too much.
i will not say anything. honest, i won't.
yeah ?how do i know?  i got to good mind to plug you.  i should not take any chances on you.
you can trust me, mister. I will keep my mouth shut.
where do you live?
orange, new jersey.
got a couple of kids, huh?
yeah. just babies.
you love them, do not you?
oh, gee, misteryou wouldn'tyou am not thinkin' about
you will keep your trap shut, all right.
suresurei'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, mister.
if you don'tever hear of bugs dooley?
no.
nice guy. just like you. but he made a big mistake, one day. got kind of talkative. know what happened? his kid was found in the bottom of the river. a rock tied around its neck. poor bugs! he could not take it. blew his brains out.
gee! that musta been terrible.  i guess he had it coming to him though. but do not you worry about me. i do not talk. i never talk. take my word for it. gee, i would not want anything to happen to my kids.
okay. just remember that. now beat it.
oh, thanks, thanks, mister. i always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
come on, scram! and stay away from that bus.
sure. anything you say.
poor old shapeley. you should not have frightened him like that.
at the rate he started, he is probably passed two state lines by this time. the exercise is good for him.
yes, i noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  ouch!
what is the matter?
i was never built for these moonlight strolls.  why did we have to leave the bus?
i do not trust that chatterbox.
first town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
not as long as I am alive.
okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
what do you meanstarvation?
it takes money to buy food.
why, have not you?
not a sou. i had some before the fainting scene.
you did not give that boy all your money?
i did not give him anything . you were the big-hearted gal. how about wiring your father now?
never! I will get to new york if i have to starve all the way.
must be some strange power westley has over you women.  how do you expect to get there?
to new york?
yeah.
I am following you.
are not you afraid of me?
no.
okay. hang on to these.
i wish you would stop being playful.
sorry.  it is the first time I have ridden "piggy-back" in years.
this is not "piggy-back."
of course it is.
you are crazy.
remember distinctly father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
and he carried you like this, i suppose.
yes.
your father did not know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
my unclemother's brotherhad four children . . . and I have seen them ride "piggy-back."
i do not think there is a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. i never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
that is silly.
to be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
and rich people have none of those qualifications, i suppose.
not a one.
you are prejudiced.
show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I will show you somebody that is human. take abraham lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer."  where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he
this looks like the best spot.
we are not going to sleep out here, are we?
i do not know about you, but I am going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
peter
what?
I am hungry.
just your imagination.
no, it isn't. I am hungry andand scared.
you can not be hungry and scared at the same time.
well, i am.
if you are scared it scares the hunger out of you.
not if you are more hungry than scared.
all right. you win. let's forget it.
i can not forget it. I am still hungry.
holy smokes! why did i ever get mixed up with you!
I will get my clothes all wrinkled.
well, take them off.
what!
all right! do not take them off. do whatever you please. but shut up about it.
what is the matter?
oh, peter
what is got into you?
oh, peter! i was so scared.
i was not gone more than a minute. just went out to find you something to eat.
knowbut
here. eat your head off.
i do not want it now.
thought you were hungry!
wasbut
but what!
was so scaredthat it scared
holy jumping catfish! you can drive a guy crazy.
comical part of it is, it is not what you want at all. in a couple of weeks you will be looking for the nearest exit . . .  people like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. i guess that is what makes you so dizzy.  you are always chasing after something. at least you think you are. truth is, you are just running away.  from yourself, mostly. 'cause you are miserable. you hate yourself. the world's full of people like you. do not know what they want.
do you know?
sure.
what?
nothing.  nothing you would give two cents for.
try me.
i just want to be let alone, that is all. life's swell if you do not try too hard. most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. they are not living. they are just feverish.  if they did not get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they would find what they want. peace and calm. when you get right down to it, what is all the shootin' for, will you tell me? after all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, does not it? sure it does. 'cause you were tiredand it is the only thing around.
you sound like a hobo.
i am. i only work when i have to. two years ago i got a notion and went to china. there was a war going on. swell! after a while it got stale. i went down to tahiti. just lay on the beach for six months. what could be sweeter?
does not sound very exciting.
what are you thinking about?
by a strange coincidence, i was thinking of you.
really?
yeah. i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
what did you say we are supposed to be doing?
hitch-hiking.
well, you have given me a very good example of the hiking
if it is just the same to you, we will sit right here till they come.  got a toothpick?
no. but I have got a penknife.
hayin my teeth.
there it is. better swallow it. we are not going to have any breakfast.
need not rub it in.  what are you eating?
carrots.
raw?
uh-huh. want one?
no!!  it is a wonder you could not get me something i can eat.
you do not think I am going around panhandling for you.  best thing in the world for youcarrots. had a tough time getting them. if that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
i hate the horrid stuff.
i wish you would not talk too much. we let a car get away.
what if nobody stops for us?
oh, they will stop, all right. it is a matter of knowing how to hail them.
you are an expert, i suppose.
expert! going to write a book on it. called the "hitch-hikers hail."
there is no end to your accomplishments.
you think it is simple, huh?
oh, no!
well, it is simple. it is all in the thumb, see? a lot of people do it
but the thumb always works. different ways to do it, though. depends on how you feel. for instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  that shows independence. you do not care if they stop or not. 'cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
clever.
number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  that means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
you figured that all out yourself, huh?
oh, that is nothing. now take number three, for instance. that is a pip. it is the pathetic one. when you are brokeand hungryand everything looks black. it is a long movement like this  with a follow through.
amazing.
hm? yeah, but it is no good if you have not got a long face with it.
here comes a car!
now watch me. I am going to use number one. keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
something must have gone wrong. i guess I will try number two.
when you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
i guess maybe i will not write that book after all.
yes. but look at all the fun you had.  mind if i try?
you! do not make me laugh.
you are such a smart aleck! nobody can do anything but you. I will show you how to stop a carand i will not use my thumb.
what are you going to do?
mind your own business.
you might give me a little credit.
what for?
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
why did not you take all your clothes off? you could have stopped forty cars.
we do not need forty cars.
hey, hey, are not you afraid you will burn out a tonsil?
tonsil? me? no! me burn a tonsil?  "my tonsils will not burn as life's corners i . . .
all right, let it go.
. . . turn."
no, thanks. we are not hungry.
oh, i see, young people in love are never hungry.
no.
"young people in love are very seldom hungry. people in love are very seldom hungry . . ."
what were you going to do? gold dig him for a meal?[13]
why not? I am hungry.
eat a carrot.
never!  I am going in and ask him
if you do, I will break your neck.
oh, peter! what happened? are you all right?
come onget in.
oh, you have been hurt! there is a cut on
come on! come on!
what happened?
just a road thief. picks people up and runs off with their stuff. what a racket!
what did you give him for the car?
a black eye.
you do not have to eat the carrots.  just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
darling!
i have not changed my mind, westley, i want you to understand that! i do not like you! i never have!  i never will! that is clear enough, is not it?
you have made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  well, it has not bothered me for a minute. ellie and i got married because we love each other. and she is proving it; as far as I am concerned there is going to be no annulment.
you have got a good thing and you are hanging on to it, huh?  all right, you win. I will just have to get used to you. i admit I am licked. but only because I am worried. I have had detectives all over the country searching for her. I have seen thousands of photographs. fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  have not slept one night this week. if i do not find her, I will go crazy.
might have been able to help if it were not for you. I have been watched so closely, i
yes. i know. well, you can help now. i issued a statement yesterday that I have withdrawn my objections. begging her to come home. i have not heard from her. apparently she does not trust me.
why should she? after all
all right. that is why i sent for you.  there is a room full of reporters out there. i want you to make a statementthat you have had a talk with methat we have reached an understandingthat if ellen comes home, i will not interfere with your marriage. will you do that?
if you really mean it, i will.
of course i mean it! i do not care whom she is married to  as long as i can get her back.
any luck?
yeah. he finally agreed to let us have a room.
what about money?
talked him out of it. he thinks we are going to stay a week. I will have to think of something before morning.
that is swell!
I am glad you think so. if you ask me, it is foolish. i told you there is no sense in our staying here tonight. we could make new york in less than three hours.
i could not arrive in new york at three in the morning. everybody's in bed.
okay.  cottage number three.
there you gotrustin' people again. how many times did i tell you
he looked like an upright young feller to me, ma.
yeah. they are all upright till they walk out on you.
said he was gonna stay a week.
mebbe.
worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
i do not trust him.
yes. you will have a great story, will not you?
yeah, swell.
is that the walls of jericho going up?
yep! the walls of jericho.
thank you.  am i going to see you in new york?
nope.
why not?
no harm in your coming to see us.
not interested.
will not i ever see you again?
have not you ever wanted to fall in love?
me?
yes. have not you thought about it at all? seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
maybe.  suresure, I have thought about it. who hasn't? if i ever met the right sort of a girl, I would  yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that is realsomebody that is alive? they do not come that way any more.
better go back to your bed.
i love you.
you are forgetting you are married.
i do not care. i love you. nothing else matters. we can run away. everything'll take care of itself.  please, peter. you can not go out of my life now. i could not live without you.  oh, peter
all I am asking is enough gas to get me to new york. the bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
yeah, but i got a bag. my wife gave me one for christmas.
listen, mani'll tell you what I will do. when i come back in the morning, I will buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? what do you say?
am not got a hat
what?
i am not got a hat.
well, you got one now. come on, fill 'er up.
get out of here!
wait a minute, gordoni
get out!
joe, listen
do not "joe" me.
okay, joe. listenyou know I have always liked you. anytime i could do you a great turnanytime i ran into a story that looked goodi always came running to you, did not i? well, i got one now. those wires i sent you were on the level. it is the biggest scoop of the year. I am giving it to you, joe.
you mean about the andrews' kid?
that is it.  i got it all written up. ready to go. all i want is a thousand dollars.
a thousand dollars!  get out of this office before i throw you out bodily.
do not get sore, joe. this is something you got to do for me. i need a thousand dollarsand i need it quick. I am in a jam.
what is the thousand bucks for?
to tear down the walls of jericho.
what!
never mind . . . listensuppose i should tell you that ellen andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
huh?
that she is going to marry somebody else.
you are drunk.
would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
if it is on the level.
well, i got it, joe.
who is she going to marry?
it is all right here. give me the thousand and it is yours.
i would not trust you as far as i could throw that desk.
wait a minute, joe. use your bean. i could not afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I would be crazy. there is not a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! i could go to jail!
I would put you there myself.
sure. i would not blame you, either.
who is the guy she is going to marry?
i am, joe.
you!
yeah.
now i know you are drunk.  I am going home. do not annoy me any more.
for heaven's sake, joestop being an editor for just a minute.  we have been friends for a long time, have not we? you ought to know when I am serious. this is on the level.
i met her on a bus coming from miami. been with her every minute.  I am in love with her, joe.
well, I will be
listen, palyou've got to get this money for me. now. minutes count. she is waiting for me in an auto camp outside of philadelphia. I have got to get right back. you see, she does not know I am gone.  a guy can not propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
i told you! i told you, you could not trust him! he is gone!
who?
that feller last night, that is who! he was going to stay a week, huh? well, he is skipped. took the car with him, too. we would not have known a thing about it until morning if i had not took that magnesia.  come on, get up, do not lay there. let's do something about it.
see that. they are gone!
looks like it, do not it?  here's the woman, ma.
oh!!
what is the matter?  where is your husband, young lady
husband?
yesif he is your husband.
is not he here?
no, he ain't! and the car's gone, too.
why, he will be back.
yeah? what makes you think so! he took his suitcase and everything.  kinda surprised, huh? it is just like i told you, zeke. they am not married a'tall . . .
thenyou'll have to git !
yeah, you will have to git .
why, you can not put me out in the middle of the
serves you right. oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. you can not go plyin' your trade in my camp.
but can not you wait until morning
am not going to wait a minute.
not a minute!
better start gettin' into your clothes.
yeah.
zeke.  git!
yes, ma.
can i use your telephone? i want to talk to new york.
you am not going to stick me for no phone calls. you can go down to the sheriff's office.
thanks, pal. you saved my life.
okay, pete.
'bye, agnes. you are beautiful. all women are beautiful!  gordon is immediately electrified into action.
oh, boy! what a yarn! what a yarn!  get me hank on the phone. gotta hold up the morning edition.
can not you get them to go any faster?  this dissolves to a deserted road, peter at the wheel of his car. his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
"i found a million dollar baby"
hello, joe. sorry. just a little gag of mine. thought I would have some fun with you.
yeah. sure. had me going for a while.
would not have made a bad story, would it?
great!  but that is the way things go. you think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
yeah, where am i?
when you sober upcome in and see me.
thanks, joe.
why; naturally, i
naturally.  you are going to become a partner in a big institution. it is one of the largest in the world.
you talk as if
someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
ellie? oh, she is no responsibility.
no?  say, listeni've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. toughest job i ever tackled. ever hear of j.p. clarkson? biggest man in the country, is not he? well, i tamed him . got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I have browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I have never been able to do a thing with her. she is been too much for me. I am glad you think it is easy.  now listenif you will do what i tell you, perhaps i might develop a little respect for you. you never can tell.
what would you like to have me do?
sock her!
try. do me a favor. try. it is your only chance. and hers, too. do that for meand maybe we will be friends  maybe.  do we understand each other?
yes, sir.
fine. I will see you at the reception.
you thought that up all by yourself, huh?
why, it will make all the front pages. a spectacular thing like that
personally, i think it is stupid!  but go ahead. have a good time. as long as ellie does not object.
oh, no. she will be crazy about it. well, see you later. I am going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  goodbye.
we have done that already.
yes, of course.
ohmary
yes, sir?
how is she?
whyuhshe's all right, sir.
what is the matter? anything wrong?
oh, no, sir. no different than
yes. i know. still in the dumps, huh?
yes sir. if you will excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the upstairs corridor in front of ellie's door. andrews enters and knocks several times. receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
ellie
oh, hello, dad.
i knocked several times.
sorry. must have been day-dreaming.
well, everything's set. creating quite a furor, too. great stunt king's going to pull.
stunt?
landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
oh, yes. i heard.
yes. personally, i think it is silly, too.
what is the matter, ellie? what is wrong?
nothing.
you have been acting so strangely since you returned. i'mi'm worried. i have not bothered to ask you any questionsi  is not all this what you wanted?  you have not changed your mind about king, have you?
oh, no.
if you have, it is not too late. you know how i feel about him. but i want to make you happy. you gave me such a scareiwhen i could not find you.  you know, the old pump is not what it used to be.
sorry, dad. i would not hurt you for the world. you know that.
i have not seen you cry since you were a baby. this must be serious.  where did you meet him?
on the road.
now, do not tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
no.
who is he?
i do not know very much about him.  except that i love him.
well, if it is as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
it will do no good.  he despises me.
oh, come now
he despises everything i stand for. he thinks I am spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
ridiculous!
he does not think so much of you either.
well!
he blames you for everything that is wrong about me. thinks you raised me stupidly.
fine man to fall in love with.
he is marvelous!
well, what are we going to do about it? where is he?
i do not know.
I would like to have a talk with him.
it is no use, dad. i practically threw myself at him.
well, under the circumstances, do not you think we ought to call this thing off?
no, I will go through with it.
but that is silly, child. seeing how you feel, why
it does not matter.  i do not want to stir up any more trouble. I have been doing it all my life. I have been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I am tired, dad. tired of running around in circles. he is right, that is what I have been doing ever since i can remember.
yes, i guess i have.  i do not want to hurt anybody any more. i want to get away from all this front page publicity. it suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. i can not walk out on king now. it will make us all look so ridiculous.  besides, what difference does it make?  I will never see peter again.
is that his name?
yes. peter warne.
peter warne!
why? do you know him?
oh, nono.
you have not heard from him, have you, dad?
why, no . . . do not be silly.
oh, please, dad
looks like that was his only interest in me. the reward.
I am sorry you read it.
are you going to see him?
i suppose so.
certainly!  pay him off. he is entitled to it. he did an excellent job. kept me thoroughly entertained. it is worth every penny he gets.
I will be going.  ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as king enters.
well, if it is not the groom himself! you are just in time, king.
how are you, ellie?  are you happy?
happy? why should not i be happy? I am getting the handsomest man in captivity.  here you are, king. let's drink.  let's drink to us .  we finally made it, did not we?
you bet we did.
it is up to you now. i want our life to be full of excitement, king. we will never let up, will we? never a dull moment. we will get on a merry-go-round and never get off. promise you will never let me get off? it is the only way to live, is not it? no time to think. we do not want to stop to think, do we? just want to keep going.
whatever you say, darling.
i heard about your stunt. that is swell, king. just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. it is a perfect beginning for the life we are going to lead. it sets just the right tempo.  come on, king. you are lagging.
yeah, but i do not like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain.
you need not see anybody. you can come directly to my study. I would appreciate it very much if
nono. what the deuce do i want to
mr. warne?
yeah.
come in. sit down.
i was surprised to get your note. my daughter had not told me anything about you. about your helping her.
that is typical of your daughter. takes those things for granted.  why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami  for the love of it?
please understand me. when i say she did not tell me anything about it, i mean not until a little while ago. she thinks you are entitled to anything you can get.
oh, she does, huh? is not that sweet of her! you do not , i suppose.
do not know. I would have to see on what you base your claim. i presume you feel you are justified in
if i did not i would not be here!  I have got it all itemized.
i sold some drawers and socks, too; I am throwing those in.
and this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
why not? I am not charging you for the time i wasted.
yes, i knowbut
what is the matter? is not it cheap enough? a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
let me get this straight. you want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
what ten thousand?
the reward.
who said anything about a reward!
I am afraid I am a little confused. you see, i assumed you were coming here for
all i want is thirty-nine sixty. if you will give me a check I will get out of this place. it gives me the jitters.
you are a peculiar chap.
we will go into that some other time.
the average man would go after the reward. all you seem to
listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? this is a matter of principle. something you probably would not understand.  when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i do not like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
you were taken for a buggy ride?
yeahwith all the trimmings. now, how about the check. do i get it?
here you are.  do you mind if i ask you something frankly?  do you love my daughter?
a guy that would fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
that is an evasion.
she grabbed herself a perfect running mate. king westley! the pill of the century!  what she needs is a guy that would take a sock at her every daywhether it is coming to her or not.
if you had half the brains you are supposed to have, you would have done it yourselflong ago.
do you love her?
a normal human being could not live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  she is my idea of nothing!
i asked you a question. do you love her?
yes!  but do not hold that against me. I am a little screwy myself.
i hope you got your money.
you bet i did.
congratulations.
same to you.
why do not you stay and watch the fun? you will enjoy it immensely.
i would. but I have got a weak stomach.
what happened?
i have not the slightest idea.
do not want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. do not want to see anybody.
but it is king westley on the phone.
ooooooh.  hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I have sent you a check for a hundred thousand. yes. that is the smartest thing you ever did, westley, not to contest that annulment. that is satisfactory, is not it? yeah. well, it ought to be. oh I am not complaining. it was dirt cheap.  do not fall out of any windows.
there is another wire from peter, sir. they are in glen falls, michigan.
"what's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? the walls of jericho are toppling."  send him a telegram right away. just say: "let 'em topple."
funny couple, am not they?
yeah.
if you ask me, i do not believe they are married.
they are married all right. i just seen the license.
they made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
yeah?
what do you reckon that is for?
blamed if i know. i just brung 'em a trumpet.
a trumpet?
yeah. you know, one of those toy things. they sent me to the store to get it.
but what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
i dunno.
