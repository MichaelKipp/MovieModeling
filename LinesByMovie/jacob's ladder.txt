excuse me, do you know if we've passed nostrand avenue yet?  excuse me.  look, i'm asking a simple question. have we hit nostrand avenue? i fell asleep.
i no from around here.
yeah, you and everyone else.
jake, is that you?
what the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
why didn't you turn on the light?
i didn't want to wake you.
gee, thanks a lot.
where is the lamp?
where are you?
if i knew i wouldn't have to ask. what did you do? i was happy the way it was.
i moved the couch. that's all.
where to?
that help?
thanks.
what do you think?
what do you mean?
the room!
oh god, jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
it is tomorrow. four a.m. how come you're so late?
roberts didn't show up. what could i say? besides, it's double time.
what happened to you?
don't ask.
you up?
no. have you seen my glasses?
where'd you leave 'em?
i don't know.
did you look around the headboard?
jezzie, i can't see.
maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
thanks.  what's that?
your kid dropped it off.
who? jed?
no. the little one.
eli. why can't you remember their names?
they're weird names.
they're biblical. they were prophets.
well, personally, i never went for church names.
and where do you think jezebel comes from?
i don't let anybody call me that.
you're a real heathen, you know that, jezzie? jesus, how did i ever get involved with such a ninny?
you sold your soul, remember? that's what you told me.
yeah, but for what?
a good lay.
and look what i got.
the best.
i must have been out of my head.
jake, you are never out of your head!
what's in here?
pictures. your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
look at these, will ya? i don't believe it. jesus, these are fantastic. look, here's my dad ... and here's my brother, when we were down in florida.
lemme see.
here. look. this is me and sarah when i was still at city college.
that's sarah?  i can see what you mean.
what?
why you left.
what do you mean you can see?
look at her face. a real bitch.
she looked good then.
not to me.
well, you didn't marry her.
is that the one who died?
gabe.
wait. don't.
i don't like things that make you cry.
i just want to look ...
ready?
just gettin' rid of the garbage.
how 'bout over there?  no wait. do me a favor. bring 'em to the back room.
they're awfully heavy.
i know. that's why i'm asking.
where's wong?
that's what i'd like to know. if you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
how was palm springs?
hot. where do i sign?
you got a nice tan, though.
tan? what tan? it faded on the airplane. i'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  two hundred dollars a night, for what?
no. i'll take the other one.  right. well it's good to have you back. see you tomorrow, probably.
if you're lucky.
jake!
how's it going?
i'm going home.
what's wrong?
i don't know. one of these days, i'm gonna see louis. my back's killing me.
now? what about the boss? he's not gonna like it.
well, i'll miss riding home with you. i was looking forward to it.
i'll be glad to avoid the crush.
i enjoy crushing into you.
come on, jake. that didn't hurt.
how do you know?
i know you. how come you're so tense today?
what can i tell you?
i saw sarah the other day.
her knee acting up?
a bit.
what did she have to say?
turn on your right side.  how about the other "right?"  i don't understand you philosphers. you've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
i was absent the day they taught that in school. what did she say?
who?
sarah.
not much. she's like you that way. two clams. no wonder your marriage didn't last. put your hand under your head. take a breath and then let it out.
ah, good. now turn to your left.
she talk about the boys?
she says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
she told you that?  did she tell you about the $2,000 i'm still paying for the orthodontist? i'll bet she didn't mention that.
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
i thought you said she didn't say much.
she didn't. that's about all she said. put your hand up. good. i think she still loves you. take a breath and let it out.
loves me!? she hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
right. she doesn't stop talking about you. you're always on her mind. that's love, jake.
she hates me, louis.
you should go back to her.
what? she threw me out, remember. she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn. only we didn't make it. she can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office.
what can i tell you, louis? after nam i didn't want to think anymore. i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree. relax, this is going to be strong.
i can't relax.
wiggle your toes.
god almighty. what did you do to me?
i had to get in there. a deep adjustment. rest a moment and let it set a bit.
i had this weird flash just then.
what?
i don't know. i've been having them recently.  you know, you look like an angel, louis, an overgrown cherub. anyone ever tell you that?
yeah. you. every time i see you. no more errol flynn, okay? your back won't take it. you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
louis, you're a life saver.
i know.
maybe it's all the pressure, jake. the money. things like that. or your wife.
why do you bring her up?
'cause she's always on your mind.
when was the last time i said a word?
it has nothin' to do with talkin'.
it's still there, jake.  even if you never say a word about it. you can't spend two years in vietnam ...
what does that have to do with anything? does it explain the barricaded subway stations? does it explain those godforsaken creatures?
new york is filled with creatures. everywhere. and lots of stations are closed.
they're like demons, jez.
demons, jake? come on. they're winos and bag ladies. low life. that's all they are. the streets are crawling with 'em. don't make em into somethin' they're not.  it's the pressure, honey. that's all it is.
those guys tried to kill me tonight. they were aiming right at me.
kids on a joy ride. happens all the time.
they weren't human!
come on. what were they, jake?
i'd like to speak to dr. carlson, please.
carlson? is he new here?
new? he's been here for years.
not according to my charts. do you have an appointment?
look, i need to see him. i know where his room is. just give me a pass. i won't be long. ten minutes.
our doctors are seen by appointment only.
damn it. i was in the veteran's out- patient program. he knows me.
what's your name?
jacob singer.
i'm sorry but there's no record of a jacob singer in our files.
whataya mean, no record?
you want me to spell it out? there's nothing here.
that's ridiculous. i've been coming here for years. listen to me. i'm going out of my fucking mind here. i need to see him.
if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. there's about an hour's wait. i'll be glad to take your name. why don't you just fill out this form?
goddamn it! i don't want a social worker. carlson knows me.
can i help you?
i'm looking for dr. carlson. isn't this his office?
i'm so sorry. obviously you haven't ... dr. carlson died.
died?
a car accident.
jesus, jesus! ... when?
last month, before thanksgiving.
how did it happen?
no one knows. they say it blew up.
blew up? what do you mean it blew up?
do you want me to get someone?
no. no. it's okay. i'm okay.
go on jake. she reads 'em like a book.
no, thanks.
it's fun.
you have an unusual hand.
i could have told you that.
you see this line here? it's your life line. here's where you were born. and this is where you got married. you're a married man, huh? oh oh. nope. divorce. see this split.
you know, you got a strange line here.
it's short, huh?
short? it's ended.
oh, terrific.
it's not funny. according to this ... you're already dead.
just my luck.
he's burning up.
total delirium.
that's some gash. his guts keep spilling out.
push 'em back.
help me!
you okay?
i wanna leave. get me out of here.
oh, come on. it's early.
where are we?
we're at della's.
where?
what do you mean? where do you think?
where's della? bring her here?
why? what for?
show me della!
hey, i'm here.
hiya jake. that was some dance.
della?
you want to see me? well, here i am.
i see.
what do you want?
just to see you. that's all.
well, how do i look?
like della.
can't you stop it?
if i could stop it, i'd stop it.
what's it say? a hundred and two?
i don't believe this. i'm calling the doctor.
what does it say?
it's gone to the top.
how high is that?
the numbers stop at 107.
what the hell are you doin'?
get your clothes off.
what are you talking about? i'm freezing.
get your clothes off!
what'd the doctor say?
that you'd die on the way to the hospital. now get into that tub.
he's coming right over.
coming here?
goddamn it. get in here. i can't stand around waiting.
you're out of your mind. i'm not getting in there. i'd rather die.
that's your decision.
look at me. i'm ice cold.
you're red hot, damn it. get in there. i've got to get more ice.
i can't do it.
what kind of man are you?
don't gimme that.
lie down!
jezzie! my feet are throbbing!
sam, tony, come in here.
hey, i'm not dressed.
help me! help me!
here. i'll do it.
i have some ice from the machine.
bring it in.
is he all right?
he doesn't like it.
i don't blame him. what should i do with the ice?
pour it in.
on top of him?
he's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
okay. my husband's got two more bags. he's coming. they're heavy.
what was that?
it's freezing.
i'm not cold.
of course not. you have all the blankets. it must be ten degrees in here. i'm telling you, sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. from now on that window is closed.
it's not healthy with it closed.
this is healthy? i'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
what a dream i was having. i was living with another woman ... you know who it was?
i don't want to know.
jezebel, from the post office. you remember, you met her that time at the christmas party. i was living with her. god, it was a nightmare. there were all these demons and i was on fire. only i was burning from ice.
guilty thoughts. see what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
she was good in bed, though.
go to sleep.
she had these real beefy thighs. delicious.
i thought you said it was a nightmare?
daddy, what was that noise?
gabe?  what are you doing ... ?
there was a bang.
it was the window.
it's cold.
tell your mother.
mom, it's ...
wait ... daddy.
now what?
don't go.
don't go?  i'm not going anywhere. i'm right here, gabe.  come on, go back to sleep. you can still get a couple of hours.
jake.  you're gonna be all right, jake. you're gonna be fine.
am i home?
you're here. home. the doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  what a night, jake. it was crazy. you kept sayin' "sarah, close the window," over and over. and talkin' to your kids. even the dead one. weird. you know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. amazing, huh?
are we in brooklyn?
you're right here, jake. you just rest.  the doctor said you had a virus. that's what they say when they don't know what it is. you can't do anything for a week. he says you gotta recuperate.  now you just lie here. mrs. sandelman made you some chicken soup. it'll warm you up.
you know, you really ought to get out today. you can't just sit around like this all the time. it's not healthy. it's not good for your mind. go take a walk, or somethin'. go to a movie. christ, who's gonna know? you think i care? i don't give a shit. go. enjoy yourself. one of us should be having a good time.  hello! anybody home?  anybody in there?
what?
look, i'm horny. keep it in mind.  love me a little?
you are the most unbelievable woman i have ever met. one second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're florence nightingale. who are you? that's what i want to know. will the real jezzie pipkin please stand up.
hello.
jacob singer?
speaking.
paul gruneger!
paul gruneger! well i'll be goddamned!
paul! you son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? i haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
a long time.
jesus christ. how've you been? what's happening in your life?
nothin' much.
me neither. nothing too exciting. so tell me, to what do i owe the honor?
i need to see you, jake.
shit, paul. i'd love to see you. but i'm kind of laid up here. i've been sick.
i need to see you.
jesus, man, you look terrific. you must have put on twenty pounds.
i work in a bakery.
you're lucky. how many vets you know are even employed?
count 'em on one hand.
it's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
no joke. fuckin' army! that goddamn war. i'm still fightin' it.
it's not worth it. you'll never win.
you tellin' me? how many times can you die, huh?
still married, jake?
nope.
you and everybody else. god i hate this area. makes me nervous.
why the hell we drivin' here?
i just need to talk.
you can't talk in brownsville?
i'm not sure where i can talk anymore.
what's wrong?
let's get a couple drinks, okay?  hey, take a look behind us. do you think that car is followin' us?
that black car?
pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  just watch 'em.
what's goin' on paul?
i don't know.
you in trouble?
yeah.
that's as straight as i can put it. and don't tell me that i'm crazy 'cause i know i'm not. i'm goin' to hell. they're comin' after me.
who is?
they've been followin' me. they're comin' outta the walls. i don't trust anyone. i'm not even sure i trust you. but i gotta talk to someone. i'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
sorry. sometimes i think i'm just gonna jump outta my skin. they're just drivin' me wild.
who, paul? what exactly ... ?
i don't know who they are, or what they are. but they're gonna get me and i'm scared, jake. i'm so scared i can't do anything. i can't go to my sisters. i can't even go home.
why not?
they're waitin' for me, that's why.
it's okay, paul. it's okay.
i don't know what to do.
don't do anything.  paul, i know what you're talking about.
what do you mean?
i've seen them too ... the demons!
you've seen them?
everywhere, like a plague.
god almighty. i thought i was the only one.
me, too. i had no idea. it's like i was coming apart at the seams.
oh god. i know. i know.
what is it paul? what's happening to me?
they keep telling me i'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  i carry these everywhere but they don't help. nothing helps. everyone thinks i'm crazy. my mother filed a report with the army.
the army?
she said i haven't been the same since then. since that night. there's still this big hole in my brain. it's so dark in there, jake. and these creatures. it's like they're crawling out of my brain. what happened that night? why won't they tell us?
i don't know. i don't know.
they're monsters, jake. we're both seein' 'em. there's gotta be a connection. something.
i'm afraid to go by myself anymore. i keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. i've seen 'em take people right off the street. i used to go home a different way every night. now i can't even go home.
you come home with me.
what about your girlfriend? you don't think she'll mind?
are you kidding? we've put up more of her cousins. you wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
bullshit. someone's covering somethin'. that was no accident.
why do you say that?
cars don't explode that way. any simpleton knows that.
but the paper ...
that was set. i'm tellin' you.
by who? why? paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
how do you know?
hey, you're talkin' about paul. who'd want to hurt him?
what did he talk about when you guys went out? did he say anything?
he was upset. he thought people were following him.
what do you mean, demons?
he told me he was going to hell.
what'd he say that for? what made him say that? strange, huh? strange.
what else did he say, jake?
he was scared. he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. they were tryin' to get him, he said.
how long had that been going on?
a couple of weeks, i think.
he say what they looked like?
no. not really ...
excuse me a minute. i'll be right back.
something weird is going on here. what is it about us? even in nam it was always weird. are we all crazy or something?
yeah, ever since that ...
grass never did that to me.
you know, i've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. nothing penetrates that night. nothing.
it's not worth goin' over again and again. whatever happened, happened. it's over.
... i've seen them, too.
shit!
dr. carlson's dead?
an explosion, just like paul's.
you think they're connected?
i think something's fucking connect- ed. i mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. doug too, right? we've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
not me, buddy.
okay, not you rod. but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. they're tryin' to kill us. fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
come on, professor. the army's not gonna give you any answers. you'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
maybe that's the only way to get through. besides, six heads'll be better than one.
not my head, buddy. not me. i'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
we should get ourselves a lawyer.
i say you should get a shrink.
too late. i've tried. i think you're right, jake. i'm game.
me, too.
i'm sorry, mr. singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? it'd break your heart.
this isn't injustice, mr. geary. the army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
the army. the army. what is it with you guys? we're not talking about a trip to the library here. this is the united states government for god's sake. this is red tape coming out of your ass. you know what i mean?
exactly. and we need someone to cut through it. we hear you're the man.
oh yeah? what am i - perry mason here?
doctor.  ph.d.
ah! i thought you were a mailman.
i am.
then why aren't you teaching? why aren't you in a university?
i'm too messed up to teach.
ah! well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
so tell me ... am i still an angel?
with wings. you transport me, you know that? you carry me away.
we're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. it's just what you choose to see.
i love you, jez.
i know.
underneath all the bullshit, just love.
remember that.
you know what? i feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
how come? the army?
in a way. at least now i have some idea of what was happening. if we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... i don't know. maybe it'd clear things up in my head. i'll tell you something, jez, honestly ... i thought they were real.
i put a frozen dinner in the oven, a manhandler. it'll be ready at a quarter of. i threw a little salad together. it's in the fridge. i also bought some apple juice, red cheek. don't drink it all. oh, and jake, your lawyer called.
he did? when?
while you were in the shower.
why didn't you call me?
he didn't give me a chance.  look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
what? what do you mean?
he said you didn't have one.
what's he talking about?
i don't know. that's all he said. he wasn't very friendly. oh, yeah. he said your buddies backed down. they chickened out, he said.
i don't believe this.
baby, i'm sorry. i feel terrible. i'd stay and talk but i'm so late. look, don't be upset. we'll talk when i get home. see you around midnight.  bye. and don't brood. watch t.v. or something.
hello.
frank. it's jake. jacob singer.
listen, i just got a strange call from geary. he said the guys backed down. what's he talking about?
that's right. we did.
what does that mean, frank? i don't get it. why?
it's hard to explain.
well, try, huh.
i don't know if i can. it's just that war is war. things happen.
things happen? what the fuck are you talking about? they did something to us, frank. we have to expose this.
there's nothing to expose.
jesus christ! who's been talking to you?  what's going on? how can you just turn away?  what about the others?
they're not interested, jake.
shit! you know it's not half the case if i go it alone. we're all suffering the same symptoms, frank. the army is to blame. they've done something to us. how can you not want to know?
maybe it's not the army, jake.
what do you mean?
maybe there's a larger truth.
what are you talking about?
maybe the demons are real.
goddamn it. what kind of bullshit is that?
listen, jake. i gotta go.
what the hell? what kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
i'm hanging up.
hey, wait!
don't bother to call again, okay?
who's been talking to you? the army? have they been talking to you, huh?
nobody's been talking to nobody. you don't have a case, you hear me? it's pure and simple. now leave me alone. okay?
listen, will you listen? they're trying to get me. they're comin' out of the walls. the army's done something to me. i need you.
you need ... a doctor.
a doctor? and what's he gonna do, tell me i'm crazy? they've fucked with my head. i've got to prove it. you've got to do something.
you mind? i'm eating, huh?
something's going on here. you're not telling me something. what the hell's gotten into you?
i'll tell you what's gotten into me. i don't know you from adam, right? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it. okay. i said i'd check it out and i did. now i don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and i don't like it.
used you?
i talked to the army's bureau of records. you've never even been to viet nam.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
it means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand.
war games? thailand? that's not true! how can you believe that? can't you see what they're doing? it's all a lie. we were in da nang, for god's sake. you've got to believe me.
i don't have to do any such thing. i'm eating my lunch, okay?
my back. i can't move. i need my chiropractor.
your back? did you fall?
they stole it.
who did?
i don't know. santa claus. i had my son's picture in it. gabe's picture. it's the only one i had.
we better get an orthopedic man in here. is dr. davis on call?
i'll page him.
call my chiropractor.
we're doing everything we can.
louis schwartz. nostrand avenue.
i'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. this may hurt a little.
no. don't move me.
i don't have to ask if you can feel that.
goddamn it. i want louis.
get me out of here.
where do you want to go?
take me home.
home?  this is your home. you're dead.
dead? no. i just hurt my back. i'm not dead.
what are you then?
i'm alive.
then what are you doing here?
i don't know. i don't know.  this isn't happening.
what isn't happening?
let me out of here!
there is no out of here. you've been killed. don't you remember?
remember?
no! that was years ago! i've lived years since then.
it's all been a dream.
no! the army did this to me! they've done something to my brain.  jezzie! i want my boys! sarah! i'm not dead! i want my family!
i'm not dead. i am not dead.
no. of course you're not. you've just hurt your back. that's all. you're going to be fine. it'll just take some time.
dream on!
no! oh god.
jacob, what can i do?
save me!
well, don't we look better this morning? that was a hard night, wasn't it?
where am i?
lennox hospital.
i'm awake?
you look awake to me. here.  drink some of this.
where's sarah? where did she go?  she was here ...
no. no. you haven't had any visitors.
that's a lie. my family was here.
i'm sorry.
last night! they were as real as you are!
this is not a dream! this is my life.
of course it is. what else could it be?
half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. mark my words.  well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
am i dead, louis?  am i dead?
from a slipped disc? that'd be a first.
i was in hell. i've been there. it's horrible. i don't want to die, louis.
well, i'll see what i can do about it.
i've seen it. it's all pain.
you ever read meister eckart?  how did you ever get your doctorate without reading eckart?  good. okay, let's turn over gently. right side.
perfect. we got it.  okay. let's just give it a little try. see if you can stand.
what? by myself?
you can do it. come on. easy. just give it a try.
what are you doing?
there's something i've gotta take care of, louis.
what are you talking about? you can barely stand.
i'm walking, aren't i?
jake, you need to rest.
not tonight, louis. no more rest.
throw that torch away, young man. give yourself up. you're under arrest.
for what? for seeking the truth?
please come quietly.
you come near me and i'll blow us all up.
we're not going to hurt you.
clear the area. this is an order!
what is wrong with you?
it's just me.
jezzie?
who else were you expecting?
let go!
where were you, jake? where've you been? why haven't you called?
stay away from me, jez.
i want to know. you tell me!
you wanna know? turn on the t.v. watch the fucking news!
why are you doing this to me? you can't just go away like that.
i can do anything i want.
don't!
it might be for me.
i'm not here. you haven't seen me.
hello ... no. he's not here. i haven't seen him all night ... i don't know when ... what? tell him what?  vietnam? ... what experiments?
who was that?
a chemist. part of a chemical warfare unit out of saigon. he said he knows me and that i'll know him when i see him.
how?
i have no idea.  i was right. there were experiments. i knew it. i knew it. my god.
how do you know he's telling the truth?
surprised, huh? i told you you'd know me. i've been tracking you for a long time. i just wish i'd spoken to you before tonight.
i don't get it. who are you? why have you been following me?
observation, mainly. clinical study. you were one of the survivors.
so first i'm arrested, right? best lsd i ever made, right down the drain. i figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if i'm lucky. that was '68.
long time ago.
next thing i know i'm on rikers island. ever been there?  suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. they tell me if i'll come to vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. well, i'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam couldn't be any worse.
shows how much you knew.
no shit. they had me by the balls. next thing i know i'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. not the street stuff mind you. they had us isolating special properties. the dark side, you know? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
yeah, sure. we were losing the war.
right. they were worried. they figured you guys were too soft. they wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? and we did it. the most powerful thing i ever saw. even a bad trip, and i had my share, never compared to the fury of the ladder.
the ladder?
that's what they called it. a fast trip right down the ladder.  right to the primal fear, the base anger. i'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. but i don't need to tell you. you know.
anyway, this big offensive was coming up. everyone knew it; time magazine, huntley-brinkley. and the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. morale was down. it was gettin' ugly in the states. hell, you remember.
like it was yesterday.
a couple days later they decided to use the ladder, on one test battalion. yours. just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. and you did, too. but not the way they tnought.
none of us can remember that night. i get flashes of it but they don't make sense. we saw shrinks for years. but nothing they did could ever touch it. what happened? was there ever an offensive?
a couple of days later. it was fierce. you guys never saw it.
but there was an attack. i can still see them coming. there was a fight, wasn't there?
yeah. but not with the cong.
who then?
i always suspected the effects might come back. that's why i had to follow you. i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
if you knew, why didn't you say anything?
the truth can kill, my friend. five hundred men died out there. this isn't a story they'd ever want out. when paul's car blew up i realized the scope of the thing. i knew they meant business.
so why tell me now?
because i can get rid of the demons. i can block the ladder. i have an antidote. we can kill them off, chemically speaking. they'll all disappear. it's chemistry, my friend. i know. i created it. come with me. i can help.
you come here often?
sometimes. when it's convenient.
how do i know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
hey, i'm not the problem. you've got bigger problems than me.
i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it.
never?
i'd hoped i'd never have to. just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
what is it?
don't worry. take it. it'll free your head. come on.
i don't know.
"yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil," but no one ever said i wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  stick out your tongue.  that'a boy. now why don't you just lie down and relax.
one drop?
it's strong stuff.
i think i'm falling asleep.
pleasant dreams.
i can't move.
just relax.
what's happening? help me.
and no more demons. i told you they'd be gone.
i don't believe this. it's a miracle, michael. a miracle.
better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
it was paradise, michael. you showed it to me. you were there.
well that's good to know.
mike, it was real. it was glorious.
glorious. i'm not surprised. i fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. i'm just glad you came back.
i would have stayed there if i could.
i'm sure. you've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
here. i've got every credit card ever printed. take this. stay here till you can arrange to get away. it's on me.
no. i couldn't.
what? you want the plaza? don't be foolish. here. take this, too.  this is my place on prince street. it's got my phone, everything. call if you need me ... but you won't. everything's gonna work out. you just get outta town as fast as you can. the new york police can be effective when they want to be.
i don't know what to say.
save the words ... just send back my credit card.
what are you doing here? are you all right? how do you expect to pay for this?  everyone's looking for you, jake. i dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. i don't know what you're gonna do.
i'm gonna make love to you. that's what i'm gonna do.
are you out of your mind?
yep. finally. i love you, jez.
god, i can't keep up with all your changes.
me neither.
what's gotten into you?
it's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. it's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
i tell you, it was so wonderful. i felt like a little boy. i saw paradise, jezzie.
it's so hard to believe.
this is one of my dreams, jake. ever since i was a little girl. i never thought it would happen.
stick with me, kid.
i want to go with you, jake. wherever you go.
it's not practical, jez. it'll be hard enough alone.
i can waitress. i'm good.
no. things are too hot. later. i'll send for you.
bullshit!
i promise.
please.
no. i'm a marked man, jez. i'm the only one left. i don't want to expose you to that. it's not right for you or me. be reasonable.
reasonable? reasonable? jake ... you're gettin' me angry.
i love you when you're angry.
oh yeah?  try leavin' without me.
dream on!
what?!
dr. singer. it's been a long time.
hello, sam.
are you all right?
i'm okay.
do you want some help? i can call upstairs.
no, don't. but thanks.
what're you ... ? where's sarah? where are the boys?
sit down, jake.
where are they?
sit down.
no! what's going on? where's my family?
it's over, jake. it's all over.
where have they gone?
wake up. stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
what's going on?
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
what's wrong, jake?  forget to take your antidote?
who are you? what are you doing to me?
you have quite a mind, jake. i loved your friends. that chemist - the ladder. what an imagination you have!
who are you?
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
tell me, damn you!
you know who i am.
are you in the service?
the postal service. i'm a mailman.
ah. neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... i always admired that.
it's good to see you.
likewise.
and how is your wife? sarah, no?
i haven't seen her in months.
ah!
i'm with another woman now. we're both with the post office, midtown, 34th street branch.
hmm. i don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
oh, you'd be surprised. they just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
last i heard you were offered a posi- tion in the west somewhere. tuscon was it?
oh, that goes way back. they had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. bad timing for me though. middle of the war. the draft.  i'll tell you prof, after viet nam ... i didn't want to think anymore. i decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree.  tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
i doubt it's my mind that interests her. i tell you prof, she's a fiery lady.
well, try not to get burned. you have a great mind, jacob. don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
i've got a problem, prof. more augus- tine than kierkegaard, if you know what i mean.  i need to know about ... demons.
demons, jacob? why demons? are you writing ... ?
no.  i see them.
see them?  what do you mean? physically?
yes.
i know very little about demons, ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. i know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... dante, milton ... but jacob,  this is the 20th century. we don't see demons now.
i see them, prof. everywhere. they're invading my life.
christ, i know how it sounds.
have you considered a doctor? a psy- chiatrist?
yes.  i don't want them. i'm not looking for analysis or drugs. it's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  it's more than that. i can feel it. i need you prof. you're the only one i can talk to.
i don't know what to say.
i need your insight, your intuition.
demons? i don't know what to tell you. it sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. the problem, jacob, is that you have no context for it. you're a renegade existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after freud. how the hell am i supposed to make it fit?
i'm afraid, prof. nothing makes sense.  please help me.
jacob, i don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. i don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. i don't believe in enternal damnation. i don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. we don't need them. we do a good enough job on ourselves.
but i see them.
look. i don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. for all i know it's pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart. but if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, i admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. what can i say? it's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. but to be pursued by ... demons no less ... there are no guides, jacob.  you wanna know what i'd do if i sud- denly started seeing demons? i'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. i'm no saint.
hell, you think i am?
i'venever understood you, you know that? you were by far the best pupil i've ever had, bar none. intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. nothing would surprise me about you jacob. nothing.
he's burning up.
total delirium.
he'll never make it.
that's some gash. his guts keep spilling out.
push 'em back.
help me!
so tell me ... am i still an angel?
with wings.  you transport me, you know that? you carry me away.
it's going to be all right, jake. it's going to be all right. don't be afraid. i've got you now.
hold me, jezzie. hold me.
why won't you answer me?
cause you know goddamn well who i am.
i don't know you.
you've lived with me for two years.
that doesn't mean shit. where do you come from, huh? and i don't mean indiana.
what do you want me to say? my mother's tummy?
you know goddamn well what i mean.
you're out of your fucking mind. i'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
well leave then. go to hell.
you son-of-a-bitch. who do you think you are? i don't deserve this. who takes care of you day and night? who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? well, i've had it. you flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. i'm done holding your hand. i don't want anything to do with you, you hear? nothing!
what'd you do that for? it's an in- teresting story. all these people are still disappearing. right off the street.  hey, what's wrong? are you all right?
i'm okay. i just don't want to lis- ten.
you look upset.
i'm not upset.
jake, what is it?
i'm tired.
you look terrible. what happened?  jake ... is it the antidote?
goddamn it. why do you say that?
look at yourself. you look like you've seen a ghost.
shit! can't i just have a bad day?
you can have anything you want.
then don't bug me.
i'm not bugging you. come and lie down. i'll give you a massage.  where'd you go today?
mid-town mostly.
oh yeah? what was happenin' there?
i picked up my ticket.  i'm leaving in the morning, jez.
oh?  where you going?
west.
where's west? new jersey?
don't be funny.
i always liked the west, west of il- linois anyway. but you gotta give me time to pack.
stop it, jez. don't do that.
do what? i haven't done a thing.
don't play games with me. there's nothing more to say.
where's sarah? where are the boys?
sit down, jake.
where are they?
sit down!
no! what's going on? where's my family?
it's over, jake. it's all over.
where have they gone?
wake up! stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
this isn't happening.
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
oh god!
what's wrong, jake?  forget to take your antidote?
goddamn you!
i loved your chemist, jake. the height of fantasy. and your vision of paradise.  a most romantic creation. you're quite a dreamer, jake. only it's time to wake up.
who are you?
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
tell me, damn you!
you know who i am.
daddy!
oh god!
you're hurting me!
stop!!!!
daddy. let go.
what do you want from me?
let go!
excuse me, do you know if we've passed nostrand avenue yet?  excuse me.  look, i'm asking a simple question. have we hit nostrand avenue? i fell asleep.
i no from around here.
yeah, you and everyone else.
jake, is that you?
what the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
why didn't you turn on the light?
i didn't want to wake you.
gee, thanks a lot.
where is the lamp?
where are you?
if i knew i wouldn't have to ask. what did you do? i was happy the way it was.
i moved the couch. that's all.
where to?
that help?
thanks.
what do you think?
what do you mean?
the room!
oh god, jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
it is tomorrow. four a.m. how come you're so late?
roberts didn't show up. what could i say? besides, it's double time.
what happened to you?
don't ask.
you up?
no. have you seen my glasses?
where'd you leave 'em?
i don't know.
did you look around the headboard?
jezzie, i can't see.
maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
thanks.  what's that?
your kid dropped it off.
who? jed?
no. the little one.
eli. why can't you remember their names?
they're weird names.
they're biblical. they were prophets.
well, personally, i never went for church names.
and where do you think jezebel comes from?
i don't let anybody call me that.
you're a real heathen, you know that, jezzie? jesus, how did i ever get involved with such a ninny?
you sold your soul, remember? that's what you told me.
yeah, but for what?
a good lay.
and look what i got.
the best.
i must have been out of my head.
jake, you are never out of your head!
what's in here?
pictures. your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
look at these, will ya? i don't believe it. jesus, these are fantastic. look, here's my dad ... and here's my brother, when we were down in florida.
lemme see.
here. look. this is me and sarah when i was still at city college.
that's sarah?  i can see what you mean.
what?
why you left.
what do you mean you can see?
look at her face. a real bitch.
she looked good then.
not to me.
well, you didn't marry her.
is that the one who died?
gabe.
wait. don't.
i don't like things that make you cry.
i just want to look ...
ready?
just gettin' rid of the garbage.
how 'bout over there?  no wait. do me a favor. bring 'em to the back room.
they're awfully heavy.
i know. that's why i'm asking.
where's wong?
that's what i'd like to know. if you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
how was palm springs?
hot. where do i sign?
you got a nice tan, though.
tan? what tan? it faded on the airplane. i'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  two hundred dollars a night, for what?
no. i'll take the other one.  right. well it's good to have you back. see you tomorrow, probably.
if you're lucky.
jake!
how's it going?
i'm going home.
what's wrong?
i don't know. one of these days, i'm gonna see louis. my back's killing me.
now? what about the boss? he's not gonna like it.
well, i'll miss riding home with you. i was looking forward to it.
i'll be glad to avoid the crush.
i enjoy crushing into you.
come on, jake. that didn't hurt.
how do you know?
i know you. how come you're so tense today?
what can i tell you?
i saw sarah the other day.
her knee acting up?
a bit.
what did she have to say?
turn on your right side.  how about the other "right?"  i don't understand you philosphers. you've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
i was absent the day they taught that in school. what did she say?
who?
sarah.
not much. she's like you that way. two clams. no wonder your marriage didn't last. put your hand under your head. take a breath and then let it out.
ah, good. now turn to your left.
she talk about the boys?
she says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
she told you that?  did she tell you about the $2,000 i'm still paying for the orthodontist? i'll bet she didn't mention that.
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
i thought you said she didn't say much.
she didn't. that's about all she said. put your hand up. good. i think she still loves you. take a breath and let it out.
loves me!? she hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
right. she doesn't stop talking about you. you're always on her mind. that's love, jake.
she hates me, louis.
you should go back to her.
what? she threw me out, remember. she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn. only we didn't make it. she can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office.
what can i tell you, louis? after nam i didn't want to think anymore. i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree. relax, this is going to be strong.
i can't relax.
wiggle your toes.
god almighty. what did you do to me?
i had to get in there. a deep adjustment. rest a moment and let it set a bit.
i had this weird flash just then.
what?
i don't know. i've been having them recently.  you know, you look like an angel, louis, an overgrown cherub. anyone ever tell you that?
yeah. you. every time i see you. no more errol flynn, okay? your back won't take it. you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
louis, you're a life saver.
i know.
maybe it's all the pressure, jake. the money. things like that. or your wife.
why do you bring her up?
'cause she's always on your mind.
when was the last time i said a word?
it has nothin' to do with talkin'.
it's still there, jake.  even if you never say a word about it. you can't spend two years in vietnam ...
what does that have to do with anything? does it explain the barricaded subway stations? does it explain those godforsaken creatures?
new york is filled with creatures. everywhere. and lots of stations are closed.
they're like demons, jez.
demons, jake? come on. they're winos and bag ladies. low life. that's all they are. the streets are crawling with 'em. don't make em into somethin' they're not.  it's the pressure, honey. that's all it is.
those guys tried to kill me tonight. they were aiming right at me.
kids on a joy ride. happens all the time.
they weren't human!
come on. what were they, jake?
i'd like to speak to dr. carlson, please.
carlson? is he new here?
new? he's been here for years.
not according to my charts. do you have an appointment?
look, i need to see him. i know where his room is. just give me a pass. i won't be long. ten minutes.
our doctors are seen by appointment only.
damn it. i was in the veteran's out- patient program. he knows me.
what's your name?
jacob singer.
i'm sorry but there's no record of a jacob singer in our files.
whataya mean, no record?
you want me to spell it out? there's nothing here.
that's ridiculous. i've been coming here for years. listen to me. i'm going out of my fucking mind here. i need to see him.
if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. there's about an hour's wait. i'll be glad to take your name. why don't you just fill out this form?
goddamn it! i don't want a social worker. carlson knows me.
can i help you?
i'm looking for dr. carlson. isn't this his office?
i'm so sorry. obviously you haven't ... dr. carlson died.
died?
a car accident.
jesus, jesus! ... when?
last month, before thanksgiving.
how did it happen?
no one knows. they say it blew up.
blew up? what do you mean it blew up?
do you want me to get someone?
no. no. it's okay. i'm okay.
go on jake. she reads 'em like a book.
no, thanks.
it's fun.
you have an unusual hand.
i could have told you that.
you see this line here? it's your life line. here's where you were born. and this is where you got married. you're a married man, huh? oh oh. nope. divorce. see this split.
you know, you got a strange line here.
it's short, huh?
short? it's ended.
oh, terrific.
it's not funny. according to this ... you're already dead.
just my luck.
he's burning up.
total delirium.
that's some gash. his guts keep spilling out.
push 'em back.
help me!
you okay?
i wanna leave. get me out of here.
oh, come on. it's early.
where are we?
we're at della's.
where?
what do you mean? where do you think?
where's della? bring her here?
why? what for?
show me della!
hey, i'm here.
hiya jake. that was some dance.
della?
you want to see me? well, here i am.
i see.
what do you want?
just to see you. that's all.
well, how do i look?
like della.
can't you stop it?
if i could stop it, i'd stop it.
what's it say? a hundred and two?
i don't believe this. i'm calling the doctor.
what does it say?
it's gone to the top.
how high is that?
the numbers stop at 107.
what the hell are you doin'?
get your clothes off.
what are you talking about? i'm freezing.
get your clothes off!
what'd the doctor say?
that you'd die on the way to the hospital. now get into that tub.
he's coming right over.
coming here?
goddamn it. get in here. i can't stand around waiting.
you're out of your mind. i'm not getting in there. i'd rather die.
that's your decision.
look at me. i'm ice cold.
you're red hot, damn it. get in there. i've got to get more ice.
i can't do it.
what kind of man are you?
don't gimme that.
lie down!
jezzie! my feet are throbbing!
sam, tony, come in here.
hey, i'm not dressed.
help me! help me!
here. i'll do it.
i have some ice from the machine.
bring it in.
is he all right?
he doesn't like it.
i don't blame him. what should i do with the ice?
pour it in.
on top of him?
he's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
okay. my husband's got two more bags. he's coming. they're heavy.
what was that?
it's freezing.
i'm not cold.
of course not. you have all the blankets. it must be ten degrees in here. i'm telling you, sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. from now on that window is closed.
it's not healthy with it closed.
this is healthy? i'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
what a dream i was having. i was living with another woman ... you know who it was?
i don't want to know.
jezebel, from the post office. you remember, you met her that time at the christmas party. i was living with her. god, it was a nightmare. there were all these demons and i was on fire. only i was burning from ice.
guilty thoughts. see what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
she was good in bed, though.
go to sleep.
she had these real beefy thighs. delicious.
i thought you said it was a nightmare?
daddy, what was that noise?
gabe?  what are you doing ... ?
there was a bang.
it was the window.
it's cold.
tell your mother.
mom, it's ...
wait ... daddy.
now what?
don't go.
don't go?  i'm not going anywhere. i'm right here, gabe.  come on, go back to sleep. you can still get a couple of hours.
jake.  you're gonna be all right, jake. you're gonna be fine.
am i home?
you're here. home. the doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  what a night, jake. it was crazy. you kept sayin' "sarah, close the window," over and over. and talkin' to your kids. even the dead one. weird. you know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. amazing, huh?
are we in brooklyn?
you're right here, jake. you just rest.  the doctor said you had a virus. that's what they say when they don't know what it is. you can't do anything for a week. he says you gotta recuperate.  now you just lie here. mrs. sandelman made you some chicken soup. it'll warm you up.
you know, you really ought to get out today. you can't just sit around like this all the time. it's not healthy. it's not good for your mind. go take a walk, or somethin'. go to a movie. christ, who's gonna know? you think i care? i don't give a shit. go. enjoy yourself. one of us should be having a good time.  hello! anybody home?  anybody in there?
what?
look, i'm horny. keep it in mind.  love me a little?
you are the most unbelievable woman i have ever met. one second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're florence nightingale. who are you? that's what i want to know. will the real jezzie pipkin please stand up.
hello.
jacob singer?
speaking.
paul gruneger!
paul gruneger! well i'll be goddamned!
paul! you son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? i haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
a long time.
jesus christ. how've you been? what's happening in your life?
nothin' much.
me neither. nothing too exciting. so tell me, to what do i owe the honor?
i need to see you, jake.
shit, paul. i'd love to see you. but i'm kind of laid up here. i've been sick.
i need to see you.
jesus, man, you look terrific. you must have put on twenty pounds.
i work in a bakery.
you're lucky. how many vets you know are even employed?
count 'em on one hand.
it's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
no joke. fuckin' army! that goddamn war. i'm still fightin' it.
it's not worth it. you'll never win.
you tellin' me? how many times can you die, huh?
still married, jake?
nope.
you and everybody else. god i hate this area. makes me nervous.
why the hell we drivin' here?
i just need to talk.
you can't talk in brownsville?
i'm not sure where i can talk anymore.
what's wrong?
let's get a couple drinks, okay?  hey, take a look behind us. do you think that car is followin' us?
that black car?
pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  just watch 'em.
what's goin' on paul?
i don't know.
you in trouble?
yeah.
that's as straight as i can put it. and don't tell me that i'm crazy 'cause i know i'm not. i'm goin' to hell. they're comin' after me.
who is?
they've been followin' me. they're comin' outta the walls. i don't trust anyone. i'm not even sure i trust you. but i gotta talk to someone. i'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
sorry. sometimes i think i'm just gonna jump outta my skin. they're just drivin' me wild.
who, paul? what exactly ... ?
i don't know who they are, or what they are. but they're gonna get me and i'm scared, jake. i'm so scared i can't do anything. i can't go to my sisters. i can't even go home.
why not?
they're waitin' for me, that's why.
it's okay, paul. it's okay.
i don't know what to do.
don't do anything.  paul, i know what you're talking about.
what do you mean?
i've seen them too ... the demons!
you've seen them?
everywhere, like a plague.
god almighty. i thought i was the only one.
me, too. i had no idea. it's like i was coming apart at the seams.
oh god. i know. i know.
what is it paul? what's happening to me?
they keep telling me i'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  i carry these everywhere but they don't help. nothing helps. everyone thinks i'm crazy. my mother filed a report with the army.
the army?
she said i haven't been the same since then. since that night. there's still this big hole in my brain. it's so dark in there, jake. and these creatures. it's like they're crawling out of my brain. what happened that night? why won't they tell us?
i don't know. i don't know.
they're monsters, jake. we're both seein' 'em. there's gotta be a connection. something.
i'm afraid to go by myself anymore. i keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. i've seen 'em take people right off the street. i used to go home a different way every night. now i can't even go home.
you come home with me.
what about your girlfriend? you don't think she'll mind?
are you kidding? we've put up more of her cousins. you wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
bullshit. someone's covering somethin'. that was no accident.
why do you say that?
cars don't explode that way. any simpleton knows that.
but the paper ...
that was set. i'm tellin' you.
by who? why? paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
how do you know?
hey, you're talkin' about paul. who'd want to hurt him?
what did he talk about when you guys went out? did he say anything?
he was upset. he thought people were following him.
what do you mean, demons?
he told me he was going to hell.
what'd he say that for? what made him say that? strange, huh? strange.
what else did he say, jake?
he was scared. he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. they were tryin' to get him, he said.
how long had that been going on?
a couple of weeks, i think.
he say what they looked like?
no. not really ...
excuse me a minute. i'll be right back.
something weird is going on here. what is it about us? even in nam it was always weird. are we all crazy or something?
yeah, ever since that ...
grass never did that to me.
you know, i've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. nothing penetrates that night. nothing.
it's not worth goin' over again and again. whatever happened, happened. it's over.
... i've seen them, too.
shit!
dr. carlson's dead?
an explosion, just like paul's.
you think they're connected?
i think something's fucking connect- ed. i mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. doug too, right? we've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
not me, buddy.
okay, not you rod. but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. they're tryin' to kill us. fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
come on, professor. the army's not gonna give you any answers. you'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
maybe that's the only way to get through. besides, six heads'll be better than one.
not my head, buddy. not me. i'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
we should get ourselves a lawyer.
i say you should get a shrink.
too late. i've tried. i think you're right, jake. i'm game.
me, too.
i'm sorry, mr. singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? it'd break your heart.
this isn't injustice, mr. geary. the army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
the army. the army. what is it with you guys? we're not talking about a trip to the library here. this is the united states government for god's sake. this is red tape coming out of your ass. you know what i mean?
exactly. and we need someone to cut through it. we hear you're the man.
oh yeah? what am i - perry mason here?
doctor.  ph.d.
ah! i thought you were a mailman.
i am.
then why aren't you teaching? why aren't you in a university?
i'm too messed up to teach.
ah! well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
so tell me ... am i still an angel?
with wings. you transport me, you know that? you carry me away.
we're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. it's just what you choose to see.
i love you, jez.
i know.
underneath all the bullshit, just love.
remember that.
you know what? i feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
how come? the army?
in a way. at least now i have some idea of what was happening. if we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... i don't know. maybe it'd clear things up in my head. i'll tell you something, jez, honestly ... i thought they were real.
i put a frozen dinner in the oven, a manhandler. it'll be ready at a quarter of. i threw a little salad together. it's in the fridge. i also bought some apple juice, red cheek. don't drink it all. oh, and jake, your lawyer called.
he did? when?
while you were in the shower.
why didn't you call me?
he didn't give me a chance.  look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
what? what do you mean?
he said you didn't have one.
what's he talking about?
i don't know. that's all he said. he wasn't very friendly. oh, yeah. he said your buddies backed down. they chickened out, he said.
i don't believe this.
baby, i'm sorry. i feel terrible. i'd stay and talk but i'm so late. look, don't be upset. we'll talk when i get home. see you around midnight.  bye. and don't brood. watch t.v. or something.
hello.
frank. it's jake. jacob singer.
listen, i just got a strange call from geary. he said the guys backed down. what's he talking about?
that's right. we did.
what does that mean, frank? i don't get it. why?
it's hard to explain.
well, try, huh.
i don't know if i can. it's just that war is war. things happen.
things happen? what the fuck are you talking about? they did something to us, frank. we have to expose this.
there's nothing to expose.
jesus christ! who's been talking to you?  what's going on? how can you just turn away?  what about the others?
they're not interested, jake.
shit! you know it's not half the case if i go it alone. we're all suffering the same symptoms, frank. the army is to blame. they've done something to us. how can you not want to know?
maybe it's not the army, jake.
what do you mean?
maybe there's a larger truth.
what are you talking about?
maybe the demons are real.
goddamn it. what kind of bullshit is that?
listen, jake. i gotta go.
what the hell? what kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
i'm hanging up.
hey, wait!
don't bother to call again, okay?
who's been talking to you? the army? have they been talking to you, huh?
nobody's been talking to nobody. you don't have a case, you hear me? it's pure and simple. now leave me alone. okay?
listen, will you listen? they're trying to get me. they're comin' out of the walls. the army's done something to me. i need you.
you need ... a doctor.
a doctor? and what's he gonna do, tell me i'm crazy? they've fucked with my head. i've got to prove it. you've got to do something.
you mind? i'm eating, huh?
something's going on here. you're not telling me something. what the hell's gotten into you?
i'll tell you what's gotten into me. i don't know you from adam, right? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it. okay. i said i'd check it out and i did. now i don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and i don't like it.
used you?
i talked to the army's bureau of records. you've never even been to viet nam.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
it means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand.
war games? thailand? that's not true! how can you believe that? can't you see what they're doing? it's all a lie. we were in da nang, for god's sake. you've got to believe me.
i don't have to do any such thing. i'm eating my lunch, okay?
my back. i can't move. i need my chiropractor.
your back? did you fall?
they stole it.
who did?
i don't know. santa claus. i had my son's picture in it. gabe's picture. it's the only one i had.
we better get an orthopedic man in here. is dr. davis on call?
i'll page him.
call my chiropractor.
we're doing everything we can.
louis schwartz. nostrand avenue.
i'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. this may hurt a little.
no. don't move me.
i don't have to ask if you can feel that.
goddamn it. i want louis.
get me out of here.
where do you want to go?
take me home.
home?  this is your home. you're dead.
dead? no. i just hurt my back. i'm not dead.
what are you then?
i'm alive.
then what are you doing here?
i don't know. i don't know.  this isn't happening.
what isn't happening?
let me out of here!
there is no out of here. you've been killed. don't you remember?
remember?
no! that was years ago! i've lived years since then.
it's all been a dream.
no! the army did this to me! they've done something to my brain.  jezzie! i want my boys! sarah! i'm not dead! i want my family!
i'm not dead. i am not dead.
no. of course you're not. you've just hurt your back. that's all. you're going to be fine. it'll just take some time.
dream on!
no! oh god.
jacob, what can i do?
save me!
well, don't we look better this morning? that was a hard night, wasn't it?
where am i?
lennox hospital.
i'm awake?
you look awake to me. here.  drink some of this.
where's sarah? where did she go?  she was here ...
no. no. you haven't had any visitors.
that's a lie. my family was here.
i'm sorry.
last night! they were as real as you are!
this is not a dream! this is my life.
of course it is. what else could it be?
half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. mark my words.  well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
am i dead, louis?  am i dead?
from a slipped disc? that'd be a first.
i was in hell. i've been there. it's horrible. i don't want to die, louis.
well, i'll see what i can do about it.
i've seen it. it's all pain.
you ever read meister eckart?  how did you ever get your doctorate without reading eckart?  good. okay, let's turn over gently. right side.
perfect. we got it.  okay. let's just give it a little try. see if you can stand.
what? by myself?
you can do it. come on. easy. just give it a try.
what are you doing?
there's something i've gotta take care of, louis.
what are you talking about? you can barely stand.
i'm walking, aren't i?
jake, you need to rest.
not tonight, louis. no more rest.
throw that torch away, young man. give yourself up. you're under arrest.
for what? for seeking the truth?
please come quietly.
you come near me and i'll blow us all up.
we're not going to hurt you.
clear the area. this is an order!
what is wrong with you?
it's just me.
jezzie?
who else were you expecting?
let go!
where were you, jake? where've you been? why haven't you called?
stay away from me, jez.
i want to know. you tell me!
you wanna know? turn on the t.v. watch the fucking news!
why are you doing this to me? you can't just go away like that.
i can do anything i want.
don't!
it might be for me.
i'm not here. you haven't seen me.
hello ... no. he's not here. i haven't seen him all night ... i don't know when ... what? tell him what?  vietnam? ... what experiments?
who was that?
a chemist. part of a chemical warfare unit out of saigon. he said he knows me and that i'll know him when i see him.
how?
i have no idea.  i was right. there were experiments. i knew it. i knew it. my god.
how do you know he's telling the truth?
surprised, huh? i told you you'd know me. i've been tracking you for a long time. i just wish i'd spoken to you before tonight.
i don't get it. who are you? why have you been following me?
observation, mainly. clinical study. you were one of the survivors.
so first i'm arrested, right? best lsd i ever made, right down the drain. i figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if i'm lucky. that was '68.
long time ago.
next thing i know i'm on rikers island. ever been there?  suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. they tell me if i'll come to vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. well, i'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam couldn't be any worse.
shows how much you knew.
no shit. they had me by the balls. next thing i know i'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. not the street stuff mind you. they had us isolating special properties. the dark side, you know? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
yeah, sure. we were losing the war.
right. they were worried. they figured you guys were too soft. they wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? and we did it. the most powerful thing i ever saw. even a bad trip, and i had my share, never compared to the fury of the ladder.
the ladder?
that's what they called it. a fast trip right down the ladder.  right to the primal fear, the base anger. i'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. but i don't need to tell you. you know.
anyway, this big offensive was coming up. everyone knew it; time magazine, huntley-brinkley. and the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. morale was down. it was gettin' ugly in the states. hell, you remember.
like it was yesterday.
a couple days later they decided to use the ladder, on one test battalion. yours. just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. and you did, too. but not the way they tnought.
none of us can remember that night. i get flashes of it but they don't make sense. we saw shrinks for years. but nothing they did could ever touch it. what happened? was there ever an offensive?
a couple of days later. it was fierce. you guys never saw it.
but there was an attack. i can still see them coming. there was a fight, wasn't there?
yeah. but not with the cong.
who then?
i always suspected the effects might come back. that's why i had to follow you. i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
if you knew, why didn't you say anything?
the truth can kill, my friend. five hundred men died out there. this isn't a story they'd ever want out. when paul's car blew up i realized the scope of the thing. i knew they meant business.
so why tell me now?
because i can get rid of the demons. i can block the ladder. i have an antidote. we can kill them off, chemically speaking. they'll all disappear. it's chemistry, my friend. i know. i created it. come with me. i can help.
you come here often?
sometimes. when it's convenient.
how do i know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
hey, i'm not the problem. you've got bigger problems than me.
i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it.
never?
i'd hoped i'd never have to. just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
what is it?
don't worry. take it. it'll free your head. come on.
i don't know.
"yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil," but no one ever said i wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  stick out your tongue.  that'a boy. now why don't you just lie down and relax.
one drop?
it's strong stuff.
i think i'm falling asleep.
pleasant dreams.
i can't move.
just relax.
what's happening? help me.
and no more demons. i told you they'd be gone.
i don't believe this. it's a miracle, michael. a miracle.
better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
it was paradise, michael. you showed it to me. you were there.
well that's good to know.
mike, it was real. it was glorious.
glorious. i'm not surprised. i fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. i'm just glad you came back.
i would have stayed there if i could.
i'm sure. you've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
here. i've got every credit card ever printed. take this. stay here till you can arrange to get away. it's on me.
no. i couldn't.
what? you want the plaza? don't be foolish. here. take this, too.  this is my place on prince street. it's got my phone, everything. call if you need me ... but you won't. everything's gonna work out. you just get outta town as fast as you can. the new york police can be effective when they want to be.
i don't know what to say.
save the words ... just send back my credit card.
what are you doing here? are you all right? how do you expect to pay for this?  everyone's looking for you, jake. i dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. i don't know what you're gonna do.
i'm gonna make love to you. that's what i'm gonna do.
are you out of your mind?
yep. finally. i love you, jez.
god, i can't keep up with all your changes.
me neither.
what's gotten into you?
it's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. it's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
i tell you, it was so wonderful. i felt like a little boy. i saw paradise, jezzie.
it's so hard to believe.
this is one of my dreams, jake. ever since i was a little girl. i never thought it would happen.
stick with me, kid.
i want to go with you, jake. wherever you go.
it's not practical, jez. it'll be hard enough alone.
i can waitress. i'm good.
no. things are too hot. later. i'll send for you.
bullshit!
i promise.
please.
no. i'm a marked man, jez. i'm the only one left. i don't want to expose you to that. it's not right for you or me. be reasonable.
reasonable? reasonable? jake ... you're gettin' me angry.
i love you when you're angry.
oh yeah?  try leavin' without me.
dream on!
what?!
dr. singer. it's been a long time.
hello, sam.
are you all right?
i'm okay.
do you want some help? i can call upstairs.
no, don't. but thanks.
what're you ... ? where's sarah? where are the boys?
sit down, jake.
where are they?
sit down.
no! what's going on? where's my family?
it's over, jake. it's all over.
where have they gone?
wake up. stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
what's going on?
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
what's wrong, jake?  forget to take your antidote?
who are you? what are you doing to me?
you have quite a mind, jake. i loved your friends. that chemist - the ladder. what an imagination you have!
who are you?
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
tell me, damn you!
you know who i am.
are you in the service?
the postal service. i'm a mailman.
ah. neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... i always admired that.
it's good to see you.
likewise.
and how is your wife? sarah, no?
i haven't seen her in months.
ah!
i'm with another woman now. we're both with the post office, midtown, 34th street branch.
hmm. i don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
oh, you'd be surprised. they just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
last i heard you were offered a posi- tion in the west somewhere. tuscon was it?
oh, that goes way back. they had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. bad timing for me though. middle of the war. the draft.  i'll tell you prof, after viet nam ... i didn't want to think anymore. i decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree.  tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
i doubt it's my mind that interests her. i tell you prof, she's a fiery lady.
well, try not to get burned. you have a great mind, jacob. don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
i've got a problem, prof. more augus- tine than kierkegaard, if you know what i mean.  i need to know about ... demons.
demons, jacob? why demons? are you writing ... ?
no.  i see them.
see them?  what do you mean? physically?
yes.
i know very little about demons, ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. i know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... dante, milton ... but jacob,  this is the 20th century. we don't see demons now.
i see them, prof. everywhere. they're invading my life.
christ, i know how it sounds.
have you considered a doctor? a psy- chiatrist?
yes.  i don't want them. i'm not looking for analysis or drugs. it's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  it's more than that. i can feel it. i need you prof. you're the only one i can talk to.
i don't know what to say.
i need your insight, your intuition.
demons? i don't know what to tell you. it sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. the problem, jacob, is that you have no context for it. you're a renegade existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after freud. how the hell am i supposed to make it fit?
i'm afraid, prof. nothing makes sense.  please help me.
jacob, i don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. i don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. i don't believe in enternal damnation. i don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. we don't need them. we do a good enough job on ourselves.
but i see them.
look. i don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. for all i know it's pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart. but if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, i admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. what can i say? it's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. but to be pursued by ... demons no less ... there are no guides, jacob.  you wanna know what i'd do if i sud- denly started seeing demons? i'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. i'm no saint.
hell, you think i am?
i'venever understood you, you know that? you were by far the best pupil i've ever had, bar none. intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. nothing would surprise me about you jacob. nothing.
he's burning up.
total delirium.
he'll never make it.
that's some gash. his guts keep spilling out.
push 'em back.
help me!
so tell me ... am i still an angel?
with wings.  you transport me, you know that? you carry me away.
it's going to be all right, jake. it's going to be all right. don't be afraid. i've got you now.
hold me, jezzie. hold me.
why won't you answer me?
cause you know goddamn well who i am.
i don't know you.
you've lived with me for two years.
that doesn't mean shit. where do you come from, huh? and i don't mean indiana.
what do you want me to say? my mother's tummy?
you know goddamn well what i mean.
you're out of your fucking mind. i'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
well leave then. go to hell.
you son-of-a-bitch. who do you think you are? i don't deserve this. who takes care of you day and night? who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? well, i've had it. you flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. i'm done holding your hand. i don't want anything to do with you, you hear? nothing!
what'd you do that for? it's an in- teresting story. all these people are still disappearing. right off the street.  hey, what's wrong? are you all right?
i'm okay. i just don't want to lis- ten.
you look upset.
i'm not upset.
jake, what is it?
i'm tired.
you look terrible. what happened?  jake ... is it the antidote?
goddamn it. why do you say that?
look at yourself. you look like you've seen a ghost.
shit! can't i just have a bad day?
you can have anything you want.
then don't bug me.
i'm not bugging you. come and lie down. i'll give you a massage.  where'd you go today?
mid-town mostly.
oh yeah? what was happenin' there?
i picked up my ticket.  i'm leaving in the morning, jez.
oh?  where you going?
west.
where's west? new jersey?
don't be funny.
i always liked the west, west of il- linois anyway. but you gotta give me time to pack.
stop it, jez. don't do that.
do what? i haven't done a thing.
don't play games with me. there's nothing more to say.
where's sarah? where are the boys?
sit down, jake.
where are they?
sit down!
no! what's going on? where's my family?
it's over, jake. it's all over.
where have they gone?
wake up! stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
this isn't happening.
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
oh god!
what's wrong, jake?  forget to take your antidote?
goddamn you!
i loved your chemist, jake. the height of fantasy. and your vision of paradise.  a most romantic creation. you're quite a dreamer, jake. only it's time to wake up.
who are you?
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
tell me, damn you!
you know who i am.
daddy!
oh god!
you're hurting me!
stop!!!!
daddy. let go.
what do you want from me?
let go!
