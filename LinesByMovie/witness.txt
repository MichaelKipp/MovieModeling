is this where we are going?
of course not. we are going to baltimore. it is much nicer in baltimore.
I am a police officer. I am going to have to talk to the boy. what is his name?
samuel. samuel lapp.  but what happened here is none of his affair. my sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
there'll be another train.  the man who was killed tonight was a policeman, sam. it is my job to find out who did it. i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
i saw him.
who would you see?
who would you see, sam? the man on the floor?
no... i saw the man who killed him.
anybody know about this?
i did not even know about it.
okay, sam. can you tell me what he looked like?
he was... like him.
black... i understand. what else,sam?
momma... are they angry with us.
no... no. it is just the english way.
how reliable is this kid?
oh, he is good.
amish.
yeah.
what have you got?
zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this p2p into speed.
so one of them got to him.
maybe.
you know who?
maybe.
you are still convinced there is a link to the department?
if there is not I have just wasted the last six months.
that is the problem. we need results. the press is driving us crazy over this p2p thing. calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. you know the sort of thing. it is getting political. the commissioner's getting very uneasy.
the amish boy saw him, paul. I will make it, but set donahue and the homicide department off my back or they will blow the whole thing.
when word gets out that zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. you have got 24 hours. that is all i can give you. 24 hours on your own. after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department.
tell you what... why do not you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner sunday. how 'bout that.
what's-her-name moved to buffalo.
well, anyway, do not get crazy.  I will do something for zenovich's wife.
i got there late, john.
let's just find coalmine.  listen, zenovich made a mistake. you did not let anybody down. it happens
it will not happen again.
where are you taking us?
we are looking for a suspect. we have reason to believe he is still in the area.
you have no right to keep us here.
yes i do. your son is a material witness to a homicide.
you do not understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
does not surprise me. i meet a lot of people like that.
it is not a joke.
what was that?
he wants to know who you are. your name. i told him we do not need to know anything about you.
how could you do this to me tonight? i told you i had company
sorry. it is important.
where is timmy and buck?
upstairs, asleep. where did you think?
you have got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
that is none of your goddamn business! so keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  anyway, they like fred.
oh sure, fred.
who are these orphans, anyway?
they are amish.
everything okay?
yes, thank you very much.
john said you are amish.
yes.
oh.
i do not want to stay here.
they are english. they do not understand.
i wish dawdie was with us.
i know. sleep now, liebchen.
good morning.
you did not have to...
i wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  anyway, i needed something to do. i was so angry with your brother. he is so... agaanisish!
aganishish? yeah, that sounds like john.
just a minute. I will pour you some coffee.
you are not carrying a bullwhip... how did you manage to put my kids to work?
i made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
what is so funny?
fred. the way he looked when you screamed at him.
god, fred...
at home you would never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
no? why not?
you just wouldn't. it is not the amish way.  but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night.
listen, i do not know what is going on or how you got mixed up with him, but do not you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
now what is the problem?
the problem is i do not happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
whacking?
yes. and i also want to leave this city.
believe me, I am trying to get this over with as fast as i can. but samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
we do not go into your courts.
people who do not go into our courts when they are told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
look, I am genuinely sorry...
no you are not   you are glad, because now you have got a witness.  i heard the other police talking last night.  they do not seem to like you very much.
they kid a lot.
i would not be too sure.
but not a good tired.
what is a 'good' tired. tired is tired.
your sister said you do not have a family?
no.
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own. instead of trying to be a father to hers. except she thinks you are afraid of the responsibility.
oh? anything else?
oh yes. she thinks you like policing because you think you are right about everything. and you are the only one who can do anything. and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
why do not you arrest that man? are you protecting him because policeman?
listen, I am the cop that polices the police. I am not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I will make an arrest when i know everybody involved.
but why would they murder...
because  somehow  they knew i was getting close.  look, it is narcotics... they make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. they will do anything.  and they can get away with it because they are cops.
I am afraid. I am afraid for samuel. i want to go home.
you will be safe. you do not have to worry.
last guy i would have figured. but he is part of it.
i hope you do not have any doubts about that.
if i did, I would have kept my mouth shut...  it fits, paul... fifty-five gallons of p2p confiscated four years ago... guess who was in on the collar? mac.  he salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists have not figured out how to process it. but they do now.  and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
who else knows?
just us.
okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
more people... gotta pick up where zenovich left off. people from outside the department.
maybe the bureau. or those bastards at treasury. I will take care of it.  i hate this shit, johnny. you cut their balls off for me. I am counting on you.
what is your first move?
a hot shower... i have not changed clothes in two days.
who else knows?
just us.
listen carefully, i wrote the amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, i want you to lose it for me, now. tonight.
what the hell are you talking about? what is happening.
nothing. I am not going to be around for a while. I will call you when i can.
johnny, what the fuck?
listen to me  schaeffer's part of it. maybe at the top of it.
yeah... i can put it all together when i get back, 'til then, you know nothing, understand? business as usual...
i hear you.
good. take care of that woman's name for me. and watch your ass.
put my car in the garage and close the door.
john, i do not understand any of this.
you do not know anything... borrowed your car. did not say why. and you never heard of that woman and her boy.
john, why?...
just do it!
where are you taking us now?
home.
you could not wait until morning?
you said we would be safe in philadelphia.
i was wrong.
stay for awhile. rest. I will make coffee and breakfast.
i can't.
what about samuel? will you come back to take him to trial?
who was that man?
his name is john book.
but john... why did not you go to a hospital?
no, no doctor...
but why?
gunshot... they will file reports... they will find me.
but
is the english dead?
no...
looks dead...
that has no place in this house.
i know.
did not you hear stoltzfus? what if he dies? then the sheriff will come. they will say we broke their laws
we will pray that he does not die! but if he does, then we will find a way so no one knows!
rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
i know god help me, i know that, eli.  but i tell you that if he is found here, the people who did this to him will come for samuel.
who are they?
the leadership of our district... the diener. bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top. they decided to come and see you for themselves. except stoltzfus, of course. he came the first day. i think he saved your life.
can i have something to drink?
does anybody know I am here?
only the elders.
how long?
what?
how long have i been here?
two days.
listen, thank you. thanks for everything. but I have got to go.
but you can't.
tell him his tea stinks.
you tell him. when you are able.
did you find him?
not yet.
elaine, I have come to apologize for lt. mcelroy. he overstated the department's position.
he accused john of taking kickbacks. and you know  anybody who knows john  knows that is a goddamn lie!
of course, elaine. but as long as there is any question, better johnny should come back and clear his name.
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace!
elaine, i do not want to have to take you in for questioning. you have got his car, you were the last to see him
i do not know where he is.
but... if you had to guess?
she say where he is?
i do not think she knows.
what about carter?
tight. but I am working on him.
lean on him.
you ever handle a pistol like this, samuel?
no pistol. ever.
tell you what  I am going to let you handle this one. but only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I have got a feeling she would not understand.
okay, mr. book.
john book, i would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with samuel as possible.
nobody meant any harm. the boy was curious. i unloaded the gun -
it is not the gun. do not you understand... it is you. what you stand for.  that is not for samuel.
enjoying your reading?
very interesting. I am learning a lot about manure.  what is that?
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. i have them soaking.you can wear these.
your husband's?
yes. it is good that someone can have the use of them. besides, in your clothes you would stand out to strangers.
i should tell you these do not have buttons.  see? hooks and eyes.
something wrong with buttons?
buttons are hochmut.
hochmut?
vain. proud. such a person is hochmutsnarr. he is not plain.
anything against zippers?
you make fun of me. like the tourists. driving by all the time. some even come into the yard. very rude. they seem to think we are quaint.
quaint? can not imagine why.
where is the nearest telephone?
telephone? the gunthers across the valley. they are mennonite. they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
no. I would want a public phone.
well... the store at saltzburg...  but you will not be going to saltzburg for a while.
I am going this morning.
but stoltzfus said...
i know what he said.
you can go with eli. he is taking samuel to school. but you will have to hurry.
the... bullets?
oh. the bullets.
it is me.
johnny! where the hell have you been?
never mind. I am coming in to take care of business. how hot am i?
too hot. do not do it. do not come in.
I am coming.
listen, johnny, do not do anything stupid. you could not get within a mile of schaeffer right now. so stay put... stay in touch  I will let you know when maybe it makes sense.
you hear me?
i hear you. I will stay in touch.
that is more like it.  where are you at, anyway?
where I am at is maybe 1890.
say again?
make that 1790.
sure, I am sorry. hope you do not mind me plugging in to your battery. mine's dead... how can i help? what can i do?
maybe milking.
milking?
cows. you know, cows?
I have seen pictures.
good, you start tomorrow.
did not you hear me, book? pull! you never had your hands on a teat before?
not one this big.
that is luke. he does not like strangers.
you do not say.
good morning. book, is it? you are the yankee they talk about?
i thought i was the english.
english, yankee. it is the same. my name is daniel. daniel hochstetler.  you look plain, book.  very plain.
i came to see rachel lapp.
try the house.
eli is a fine carpenter. best in the district. he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
oh?  what happened to hochstetler?
we had some lemonade and he left.
a real fireball.
you know carpentry?
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school.
what else can you do?
i can whack people. I am hell at whacking.
whacking is not of much use on a farm.
now hold on. there is a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
I am sorry. I am sure it is.
eat up, book. what is the matter with your appetite?
guess I am not used to so much.
not used to hard work. that is what makes an appetite.
eli, john is a carpenter.  as well as being a fine policeman.
eh? well then, maybe he can go to zook's barn-raising, eh? see how good a carpenter.
sure.
but... you may not be well enough.
I will drink some more of stoltzfus' tea.
when will you be going?
not long... a few days.
how can this be? how can you do such a thing? is this plain? is this the ordnung?
i have done nothing against the ordnung.
eh? nothing? rachel, you bring this man to our house. with his gun of the hand. you bring fear to this house. fear of english with guns coming after. you bring blood and whispers of more blood. now english music... and you are dancing to english music! and you call this nothing?
i have committed no sin.
no sin? maybe. not yet. but, rachel, it does not look...  do not you know there has been talk? talk about you, not him. talk about going to the bishop. about having you... shunned!
that is idle talk.
do not make light of it, rachel. they can do it... quick! like that! and then... then i can not sit at table with you. i can not take a thing from your hand. i... i can not go with you to meeting!  rachel, good rachel, you must not go too far! dear child!
i am not a child.
you are acting like one!
i will be the judge of that.
no! they will be the judge of that! and so will i... if you shame me!
you shame yourself.
you know where he is.
wrong.
you would lie to protect him.
probably.
you admit you are lying?
i admit i do not know where he is.
you are the first one he will contact.
he is got my number.
either you are a member of the club or you aren't, elton.  tell me what you know...
what i know, paul, is...  he is going to take you out...
won him over just like that.
i see.  but i hope you have a lot of sugar.  eli is ready to go to zook's.
eli says you are a carpenter, book.
it is been a while.
no matter. come with me. we can always use a good carpenter.
your hole is healed, then?
pretty much.
nail it!
yes, sir.
hey, sam...
...i want to say a thing.
what is that, sam?
you made a mistake, paul. you should not have taken elton out.
how bad did mac get you? we figured pretty bad.
I am fine. I am going to live a long time. that is what i called to tell you.
johnny
you might want to pass it along to mac.
listen to me, johnny. come in! you are out there all alone... we are getting close... real close... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in
I have already got something worked out.  be seeing you.
everything is all right, john.
pick up the hat.
never seen anything like that in all my years.
he is from... ohio... my cousin.
we'll, them ohio amish sure must be different.  our lancaster brethren, they just do not have that kind of fight in them.
john, lost control of himself. he... will be repentant.
you are rachel lapp, are not you?
yes. samuel! we are going.
you should not bother with that birdhouse.  if you are leaving tomorrow.
I am leaving tonight.  I am going to need my clothes. and my gun.
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed.
there was.
there was a time when i would have welcomed it.
i know.
i was being foolish?
no.  i was being unrealistic. even thinking about living this life.
you are so sure of that?
are not you? after today?
I am not so sure of anything as you are, john book. you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  just as i could live yours!
oh, come on, rachel. no way.
there is always a way! but you are such a... a glotzkopp you cannot see! you would rather go back to that city! to nothing! no woman! no children! no land!
land! are you crazy? I am no amishman and I am no farmer! I am a cop. that is what i know and that is what i do!
what you do is take vengeance! which is a sin against heaven!
that is your way, not mine.
that is god's way!
well in the city of philadelphia, god needs a little help!
weird, man. no fuckin' electricity. what do you figure they plug all their shit into?
they do not have any shit.
no, you listen. get out!
lady, I am here to help you. this man is very dangerous. an armed criminal.  he is got a gun, has not he?
you have no right here!
he is not in this building.
all right, where is he?
he will live.
you might have killed him!
find fergie, check the barns. I will watch these two.
is it them?
it is them, sam.  now, sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. listen to me as you never listened before.
are they going to kill you?
listen to me, sam! i want you to go across the new corn to stoltzfus'. run as fast as you can. and stay there!
what are you going to do?
I will be all right. you just do as i say.
do not let them hurt you.
i won't. now run.  fast as you can!
get back in there.
my son is out there!
nobody's going to hurt your son...
no, rachel...
i have to help him!
you are going to have to do it right here, schaeffer.
do not try me, johnny!
it is all over, paul.
move! or you die right here!
are you really ever coming back?
got to, sam. you and i are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
have you got your gun on now?
sure have, sam.
i want you to take this... to remember by.
where is my baggy pants?
here. whenever you want them.
