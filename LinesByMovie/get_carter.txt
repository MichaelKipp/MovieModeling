i mean, i was surprised when he did not turn up for work.  he was always on time.
did you work with him, keith?
at the half moon.

why would it?
it just would. he was always the same.
since when did he drink whisky?

nobody seems to know.
let her go. she will be ok.  sorry about that.
do not worry. she is bound to be upset.

no. I will be off now. i should be at work.
look, look.  get your suit cleaned.
no. it is all right.
thanks for coming.
frank was a good bloke. it is the least i could have done.

scotch, please.
piss off, ray.
eric told me of your bereavement.
yep.

uh-huh.
did you sleep well?
yes, thank you.
are you tired?
no. are you tired?
no. I am not tired,  do you eat breakfast?
gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he would heard you have been making a nuisance of yourself.
we have got to take you back to london.
he said it would be doing him a big favour.
we know why you are all steamed up, and so do gerald and sid.
but they have to be diplomatic.
put it away, jack. you know you will not use it.
the gun he means.
do us a favour?
what, and get myself beaten up again?
no chance of that.
not much.
they are friends of mine.
and that will make me feel better?
i do not want to get rough, do i?
what you going to do?
I am going to sit in the car and whistle 'rule, britannia'.
you coming back?
how could i stay away?
what happened to you, then?
how did you find me?
did they give you a rough time?
no.  you bastard. you knew they would come back.
no, i didn't,  does albert swift still live over the ferry?
get knotted.
all right. all right. i want to square things with you first.
oh yes? how?
stuff it! my girl friend's coming from liverpool tonight.  nice surprise, is not it?
I am sorry. here. this'll pay for a course in karate.
how were things between you and frank?
he was all right to me.
nothing more? just another feller?
nicer than most.
but he was just another feller, was not he?
yes.
though nicer than most?
yes. i can not help the way i am.
why did you see him so regular?
once a week?
i call that regular.
he was gentlemanly. i like that.
once a week you like a gentleman?
look, I am me, right. you are not. we are what we are, like it or not.  why all the bloody needle?
what was bugging frank?
he wanted me to leave dave and marry him. last friday i told him it would not work. dave would have killed us both!  he followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  i had to tell frank i could not see him any more. it was getting too dodgy. that was on sunday.  he said he would kill himself. i was frightened what you might do.
i do not believe you, margaret. frank was not like that.  I am the villain in the family, remember?
it is the truth.
it is. honestly.
you bloody whore. frank was too careful to die like that. who killed him?
i do not know nothing.
you did not know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
no. i did not know that.
a fairy godmother, all of your own. are not you lucky?
so where are we going, princess?
to the demon king's castle, of course.
of course. where else?
how did you know where I would be?
you were seen parking your car. the demon king waves his wand and i was dispatched to bring you to him. lucky for you i waited.
very lucky, i should think. you are drunk!
nasty.
he must have been pretty sure I would come.
oh, he was. he told me a magic spell that would make you come.
and what was that?
we are there now.
a new venture of mine. it is going to be a restaurant.  do you like it?
yes.
last night, after you would gone, i did a little bit of asking around. seeing as you were not very forthcoming,  it seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  i got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke i wanted off my back,  you know my life. machines. the arcades. nice business. looks after itself. people put money in. i take it out. not much rough stuff. it is a business that makes me very happy. but recently, I have had a spot of bother,  one of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that is already got some. the upshot is I have had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  so far as I am concerned, that is it. apparently not. these people I have offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  so I am worried. i can not fight them  i have not that kind of set-up. but I have got to fix them before they fix me. trouble is, if i try and they find out, I am dead.
five grand. it belongs to you. along with a little name I am going to give you.
what name?
kinnear. cyril kinnear.  kinnear did it.
why?
i do not know. all i know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last saturday. your brother's name was mentioned. next day, he was dead.
why?
i do not know. that is all i was told.
that is not good enough.
christ, what...
do me a favour. you do not really expect me to fix kinnear on your say-so?  just because they tried to get me on you last night, do not think you can pull the same trick. stroll on.
jack, you are wrong.
good afternoon, mr brumby. carter exits.
jack...
who is setting you up in this place?
brumby.
is he coming here?
do not worry. he is meeting the architects at the restaurant.
are not you scared kinnear will find out?
he won't. he thinks I am simple.
what does he want that bloody great country place for?
entertaining.
what kind of entertaining?
now you are asking.
does brumby get a kick out of that crap?
especially when i play the lead.
that is why you waited for me.
not entirely. no.
you sure about that?
sure I am sure.
i want to give you an oscar.
you have been watching the film.
tell me about the girl.
what girl?
the young girl. who pulled her?
i do not know.
was it albert?
should not think so.
is it one of kinnear's films?
yeah.
who set it up?  eric?
yeah.
then he must have pulled her.
expect so.
did my brother frank find out?
your brother? what you talking about?
now tell me the truth.
the girl's name was doreen. that is all i know.
and you did not know her last name?
no.
well, it is carter. that is my name,  and her father was my brother. and he was murdered last sunday. now get up and get dressed.
hello, jack,  i do not know anything, jack.
yes, you do, albert. talk or I will kill you.
i know. i know.
you can not get away from me, albert.
i know.
i did not know who doreen was. thought she was just another bird.
did eric pake pull her?
yes.
how?
i dunno. he is got his ways. he knows margaret.
when did you find out?
a couple of weeks back.
how?
no choice. i had a visit from somebody.
who?
cliff brumby. he would seen the film. he wanted to meet doreen.
and you told brumby?
do you want to be dead, albert?
last sunday afternoon, eric and two of his boys arrive with frank and tell me that he is rumbled. somehow, he is seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. they ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  i thought they would just duff him up a bit. honest.
what did you do?  albert?
nothing. what could i do?
did eric know that frank was my brother?
yes. i told him.
what did he say?
'good.'
you knew what I would do.
yes, but listen. christ, i did not kill him.
gerald wants to see him first.
shut up.
you are finished, jack. you know that, do not you? I have bloody finished you.
not till I am dead, eric.
you should not have shown the film to frank.
i had to. it was the only way i could get at them.
you could not win an egg and spoon race, eric.
sod off.
eh? have a drink.
still got your sense of humour.
