why don't you guys buy your own?
'oughta give up smoking, jocko.
what you gettin' all pretty for?
why don't you relax, frankie?
who's going to buy me a beer?
what's the matter, doris? business bad?
it sure is.
everybody givin' it away free, huh?
you gonna buy me a beer, frankie?
see duff. he's the money man.
what d'you say, duff?
give her a beer.
thanks, duff. you' a nice guy. not like frankie.
you know, doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
you think so, frankie?
hell, you got steady work.
where' you goin'?
out.
want me to come?
no thanks.
come on, honey.
where' you goin'?
'round town.
what's so hot 'round town?
take it easy, frankie.
thank you, ma'am. that's fine.
you must be new in town.
i'll have me some of that punch there, too.
haven't seen you around, have i?
no. i'm new in town.
you working?
yeah. on the section gang.
oh yeah?
you work around town?
i'm a teacher.
went to college, huh?
in birmingham.
oh yeah? that's my home town.
your folks live there?
no. my mother's dead.  you goin' back inside?
yes, aren't you?
no. never had much use for hell-howlers. you goin'?
my father's the preacher.
oh yeah? well, i guess you got no choice.
that's right.
look, i don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
maybe.
man, you won't like that back seat.
man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? you won't get no place.
hell, they're all after the same thing.
yeah. all a colored woman wants is your money.
what d'you know about women, pop?
well, i got married to one of them.
hell, i didn't know you was married.
sure. got a sixteen-year-old girl.
is that right?  think you're gonna make it with her?
just get her drunk.
how 'bout the key?
i bet she's easy jam.
that's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
what d'you expect?
you know, baby, i can't figure you out.
how d'you mean?
why d'you come out with me? you slummin' or something?
no.
so what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
you don't think much of yourself, do you?
well, that's a funny thing to say.
you keep asking me why i'm here.
yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
i like a place with lots of life.
how about another beer?
no thanks.
go on - you can have one!
hell!
what is it?
well, if it ain't duff!
how you doin'?  hi there!
we was just leavin', fellows.
let's go, jocko. the man's got homework.
see you, duff.
yeah, see you in hell.
they must work on the section gang.
that's right.
well, they seem just like everyone else.
hell, baby, i bet you think we got tails.
i guess it's hard working on the road like that.
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
i mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
that's fine with me. keeps me out of trouble.
how d'you mean?
well, i don't get on so well most places.
i see. that beer made me dizzy.
well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
you got a problem all right.
get out of here!
don't duff--
i said: cut it out!
don't start no trouble, boy!
let's go, duff.
take it easy.
how come you stay 'round here?
well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. nobody bothers with those kids.
that's why you come back, huh?
it's hard to see any change. but i'm going to stay. another year, anyway.
you got more guts than me, baby. it's a no-good town.
it's better than it used to be. eight years ago they still had a lynching here. they tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. my father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
scared, huh?
not here, duff.
i get it.  yeah, i can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
but i would like to see you again.
you would, huh? if i was you, baby - i wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
what d'you mean?
you almost got into trouble back there.
i wouldn't have let you.
hell, baby, i'm not in the third grade. well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
no, on the porch.
oh yeah, and then what?
what?
well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. now you don't want to hit the hay, and i don' want to get married.
you have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
all right, so i'm primitive. so what d'you want with me?
look, duff - most of the men i know - they're kind of sad. when i met you the other day i had a feeling that you're different. that's why i went out with you. i thought we might have something to say to each other.
hell, baby, i don't know what to say.
good night, duff.
at first it was real strange. hell, japan is a long ways from alabama. really got under my skin, though. almost didn't come back.
why did you?
i don't know. 'guess i belong here more than there.
'been up north?
yeah. knocked around for a couple of months after the army. you been there?
no.
well, it ain't that good up there neither. might as well make it here. 'course i ain't really makin' it now.
hello.
how are you?
all right, son.
so you're courtin' the preacher's girl. well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  i'm counting on you, reverend.
i understand.
wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
i know.
i'll talk to the mayor.
that'll make the folks very happy.
it's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
guess it's never been easy.
it's a changing time. sit down, son.
thank you.
well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
how come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
well, you've got to go easy. we haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
can't live without trouble, can you?  nice place you got here. real nice.
yes, the lord's been pretty good to us. i guess you're a church man, aren't you?
i guess i ain't.
why? don't you believe in the lord?
aw, i do. but 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. it's the whites that need it real bad.
i think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
i doubt it.
i see.  well, i guess we don't have much to say to each other.
i guess not.
and since we're talking, my wife and i don't want you hanging around our daughter.
well, that figures.  kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
ain't your fault.
that's the way he is.
yeah. it's just like i figured.
what d'you mean?
hell, i don't belong here. i don't know what i' been thinkin'.
look, duff - if you're free, i'm not working tomorrow.
sorry, baby. i'm goin' to birmingham.
just for the day?
goin' to see my kid.
i didn't know you had one.
yeah. well, i do.
are you married?
no, i ain't married.  well, good-bye.
surprised?
no. women're always followin' me 'round.
i'm just going in to do my shopping.
yeah, it's just a coincidence.
that's right.
i'll see you later.
come here, duff. no point running away from coincidence.
how old is your boy?
four.
what's he like?
i ain't seen him in a couple of years.
what d'you want?
guess you must be lookin' after my boy. i'm duff anderson.
'bout time you showed. door's open.
james lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
where's wilma?
she done moved to detroit.
ain't she goin' to take the boy?
she got herself a husband now. they don' want him 'round. and i tell you, man, i got no use for him neither.
i been sendin' her money.
well, she never gave me none. look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
like where?
i don't know. he's your boy.
i ain't so sure of that. if i was, maybe i'd feel different.
yeah. look, i'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
okay.
make sure he gets those shots.
they say your dad's 'round town.
'that right? i thought he was up north.
people seen him 'round.
where's he at?
i don't know.
'you will anderson?
who're you?
i'm duff.
wouldn't have known you.
wouldn't have known you.
what's on your mind?
nothing. heard you were in town.
wanted a look at your old man, huh?
yeah. that's right.
how about a drink?
okay.
what happened?
workin' a saw mill.  here's to.
baby - want you to meet duff.
hi.
he's my son!
come on, will.
what's the matter?! you mad at me?
no. why?
nothin'.  she's all right. wouldn't have made it without her. christ - haven't worked in eight months. right now, i'm waitin' for some insurance money. and man, when i get it, i got plans to make me some more.  let's get out'a here. this place gives me the willies.  you got some money?
let's stay here, will.
what's the matter?! it's a celebration!
i said, i come to town with a girl.
plannin' on getting married?
no.
'don't sound so sure.
well, matter of fact, i done a lot of bangin' 'round.
yeah. that's how me an' your mother got started. i'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. they take it all away from you.
pour your own trouble, will.
your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. did you know that?
shut up, will.
okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. i'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
is she good in the hay? no point marryin' her just to find out. is there, baby?
if you don't quit it, will, i'm leaving.
you're breaking my heart.  got to see a man about a dog.
how often does he get like that?
whenever he's got an edge on.
how often is that?
he's been hitting it pretty hard. got high blood pressure, too. i guess it's hard on him, having you around.
i asked you somethin', boy!
i heard you.
pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
great.
what d'you want anyhow? what you come and bother me for?
he's your son.
okay, boy, beat it.
come back some other time, will you?
yeah, sure. good luck.
hi.
i thought you wasn't comin'.
how did it go?
what?
your boy.
okay, i guess.
i'll have some coffee, please.
you know, i been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
what d'you mean?
just what i said. don't look so scared.
thank you.
how about it?
what happened, duff?
look, baby - i don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. i just know it is. so, what d'you say?
don't push me, duff.
yeah. wouldn't be no picnic for you. i ain't exactly housebroken.
what about that girl?
she don't mean nothin' to me. that's all over.  hell, baby - i'm askin' you to marry me. i guess you want a big scene, huh?
no. but a small one.
i'll be a monkey's kid sister! what d'you want to do a thing like that for?
'musta knocked her up.
what're you gonna get out of it, huh?
a whole lot, frankie.
like what?
like a home, for one thing.
you gonna sit at home the rest of your life? jesus!
well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
what 'you signifyin'?
i wasn't thinkin' about you, frankie.
ol' doris sure goin' to miss you.
just give him a couple of months. a girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
you know what doris told me? she say: that duff's a nice guy. wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
i guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
that's right.
man, you must be plumb outa your mind! you'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
i can see why.
well, what d'you think?
it's okay with me, baby. but how' you goin' to like it?
it'll be fine when we get done with it.
that's bessie hall. barney works at the mill.
yeah?
hey, watch out! guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
don't call them that.
that's all right with me. always liked kids.
what about him?
he could live with us.
let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
hard to get up in the morning, huh?
that's right. how' you doin', barney?
hey, boy - i'm talkin' to you.
name's duff.
how 'you doing?
okay.
looks like you're doin' a good job.
thanks.
don't say much, do you?
guess i don't.
just so you do your work.
what's the matter, boy? never smile?
i'll smile when it's funny.
so it wasn't funny, huh? well, i thought it was. what d'you say, barney? wasn't it funny?!
i know.
you' new here, man!  see you, boys.
you know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
that ain't my idea of friendliness.
like hell. you know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
like hell they wouldn't.
is that so?
yeah, that's so.
what's wrong?
smells like something crawled in there and died.
oh really? i thought it was pretty good.
come here, baby.
everything you cook is good.
duff - you know those women you used to know--
what about them?
am i as good as they?
hmmm - good coffee.
you didn't answer my question.
baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
you still didn't answer my question.
well, if you don't know i can't tell you.
you know how to box?
uh-huh. why?
my kids want me to teach them.
okay. come on. put 'em up!
like so. there you go. okay, hit me!
i don't want to hurt you.
go on - hit me!
it sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. i seen hundreds of them - all my life.
my father's never done a thing for any of them.
they all got families to support.
yeah. that's right, jocko.  those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
i guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
what's eatin' you, jocko?
nothin'. i just figure you were the right man for the job.
good-bye, frankie.
'got a good thing, man.
'see ya.
'bye, jocko.
how would you like to have a baby, duff?
huh?
don't look so scared.
you jivin' me?
well, i haven't come around.
ain't that something?!  that's just fine, baby.
we'll be all right.
man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
what about your boy?
how come you keep askin'?
i keep thinking about him.
well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
'you duff anderson?
that's right.
want to talk to you.
okay.
i hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
i don't know what you're talkin' about.
that's no way to talk, boy. now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. stirred up a lot of trouble. they're always after you colored boys.
i still don't know what you're talkin' about.
you a union man?
used to be. on the railroad.
uh-huh. well, this ain't the railroad. now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
well, what d'you know?!
look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and i aim to keep it that way. now i got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
no. you got the wrong idea.
all right, then. all i want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
want to keep your job, boy?
what d'you think?
then do like i said.  men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  well, how about it?
don't, duff.
yeah.
don't deny me, duff.
hell, baby - i met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
yeah. but just how're we goin' to make out? i got to get me a job.
you will.
pay is so damn low. i don't want my kids to grow up like barney's.
they won't.
i'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
we can always do that, duff.
yeah. yeah, i know. i'm not really thinkin' about it. anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
yeah.
where was that?
walker and williams.
what did you say your name is?
anderson.
how 'you doin' man?
okay.
cup of coffee.  i 'been meanin' to talk to you.
oh yeah?
you know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. it's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
been over to the other mill?
yeah, i been there.
it's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. kinda took us by surprise.
oh yeah? that's good.
how 'bout that furniture plant?
man, the darkest thing they got in there is coca-cola.
yeah.
now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
they done that too long in my family.
they pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
hi.
don't ask, baby - huh!  how much money you got with you?
about ten dollars.
water pump's busted. i don't know if it's worth fixin', but i need that car.
you can have what i've got. it's right there.
you know - we do have enough money. especially now.
sure, baby. 'fact, i don't ever have to work no more. when that baby comes, i can just stay home and send you back to school. how about that?
i'm trying to help, duff.
yeah!
i could work even after the baby comes. a few hours a week, anyway.
what the hell could you do?
day work.
'you kiddin'? you ain't goin' to no white home. i seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
no point fixin' it!
what're you going to do?
don't do that!
watch out!
you heard me!
i can't stand to see you like that. i know you can't help it.
stop bein' so damn understandin'.
i know just how you feel, son. but believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
don't look like there's a right way.
well, you have to be reasonable. now they say you're a troublemaker. that's no good. use a little psychology. make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
it ain't in me.
you'll be in trouble, son.  now just how do you intend to support your family?
i guess i'll rob a bank.
don't you get smart with me, boy.
so i been told.
it's for your own good.
oh yeah?  seems to me, reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
you can be cocky now, boy. but you won't make it. you won't last. i just feel sorry for josie. i knew it wouldn't work out.
well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! you been stoopin' so long, reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. you' just half a man!
maybe i could talk to bud ellis. he might have a job for you at his filling station.
oh yeah?
i'll be seeing you.
how come you don't hate their guts?
i don't know. i guess i'm not afraid of them.
you were plenty scared that night in the car.
just of getting hurt. they can't touch me inside.
like hell they can't.  they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
not if you see them for what they are, duff.
jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! so just shut your mouth.
that's two bucks, joe.
why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
okay, i will.
how you doin', boy?
okay.
want me to hold the light for you?
no, thanks.
just tryin' to be helpful.
most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. got to understand them, that's all. how you doin', boy?
okay.
seems a little loose!
she'll do.
jesus, i told you to watch it!
sorry.
that's the trouble with you boys! don't listen when a man tells you something.
she don't look no worse to me.
don't do her no good to get banged like that.
don't do her no good to go into a tree.
what did you say, boy?!
i said, she's in great shape.
i heard you! now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
fill her up?
no, boy. thirty-eight cents worth of gas. and watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
boy - you hear me?!
that'll be thirty-eight cents.
goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! who d'you think you are - king of harlem?
that'll be thirty-eight cents.
you in a big hurry, boy?
i bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
all right, you get out of here, man!
who're you tellin' to get, boy?! you watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
that dyin's gonna be done two ways.
hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. don't make no difference no-how.
what d'you mean?
nothin. quit lookin' at me like that!
duff, i love you.
well, that don't do me one bit of good!
ain't you goin' to say something?
there's nothing to say.
well, that'll be the first time.
where're you going to go?
when i get set, i'll send for you.
i don't think that'll happen.
you'll be better off without me. i ain't fit to live with no more. it's just like a lynchin'. maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
you're not a man because of a job, duff.
you don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. nothin'! and don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
okay.
duff--
like i said, baby - i'll write you.
my son? i ain't got no son. you duff?
that's right.
beat it!
take it easy, pop.
what's the matter? don't smell so good, huh? must'a broken some records.
come on, pop.
nothing you can do. been like this for days.
now you stay put!
i ain't drunk, honey.
like hell you ain't!
got a thick feelin' here.
what's the matter now?
better now.  where 'you at?
right here.
couldn't get the words out before.
better get him to a hospital.
didn't i tell you to beat it - huh?
let's go.
anything you say, baby.
thanks.
would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
guess so.
have anything in mind?
no. what you usually say, i guess.
where was your father born?
i don't know.
his profession?
well, he worked around.
and his age?
i don't know. forty-eight, i guess.
any other family?
no. just me.  me an' her.
well, i guess that's all till tomorrow.
okay, thanks very much.
want to come up the house? you can stay there till you get on your feet. there's no point paying a hotel.
no thanks, lee.
it's just that i hate empty rooms.
sure.
well, what're you going to do?
i guess i'll make me some trouble in that town.
going back, huh?
that's right.
they'll run you out.
no, they won't.
how 'you gonna live?
i can always chop cotton if i have to.  if you want a ride, i'll take you home.
no, thanks. i'll take the bus.
okay.
don't be too hard on him.
hell, i'm just like him.
i know he wasn't much of a father.
who is?!
good-bye, duff.
