where is he? he is supposed to be here.
i need to whizz.
so go dance.
with you.
i. don't. dance.
I am thinking.
no thinking. the doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
hypotheticals --
I am just wondering --
do not call him a dipshit.
you do --
and you don't.  what is she doing in there?
the address?!
york ave.
what if they expel you?
kelly would not do that.
why not?
cuz nothing happened at school.
like you would make it to june. even cutting half your classes, you have a b- average.
I am no dummy.
that is right. you just act like one.
now i can do what i want.
that is right.  the world is your oyster.
I am not hanging. I am fixing my car --
you do not need a car you can not drive for a month. go see marvin.
'bout what?
about a job.
finding the real world to your liking, mr. carter?
i want to come back.
you could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you are here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
I would do that --
how would you do that, mr. carter?
shall i give you a few ideas?
please.
besides attending all your regular classes, I would like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
for pay?
for the inner satisfaction it will bring.  saturday mornings, I would like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
I am as underprivileged as they are --
finally, I would like you to join the drama club. rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings.
I would work backstage or something?
or something. they are doing a play for the holidays.
when do i get time for me?
you don't. that is the point.
landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  some of us remember how your father --
then you remember more than i do.
your father dropped off an extra check.
i do not want his money.
it could help with a new car --
-- i like the car i have.
he goes to my father's church. he could have died --
-- this your idea of small talk?
i do not make small talk --
-- obviously.
because, growing up, books were my world.
were?
you do not know me.
your book and your brown sweater and your hair. what is more to know -- ?
-- i wear the sweater because I am cold. i read because no one talks to me. my hair is my hair. what is it exactly that is bothering you?
you mean care what you say? I am worrying about other things.
like what? the moons of jupiter?
can not you have a normal conversation?
i do not want to have any conversation.
good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
'i hope your dreams come true.'
'they won't.'
'believe in yourself and they will. let me ask you, lizzie. look in the mirror? are you pretty --?'
'is it really me?'
'yes. you're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
no way. no thanks. i can not do it --
-- you can and you will, mr. carter.
you are like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
-- this play means a lot to me.
this play -- ?
-- i know you do not suck at acting.
that is deep --
-- your act only works with an audience.
my act?!
i know you do not want help.
then we both know.  I will point. you drive. faster.
yeah.
why?
because that is where the fire is?
fire is like a living thing. wild. unpredictable.
like me.
no. not like you.
what the -- ?!
so you agree you need help?
what is with the friggin numbers?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
I am an enemy?
kinda. yeah.
the reason i got the part... I am a little like lizzie. except i do not worry about some man rescuing me.
good thing.
you got some kind of list?
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
maybe a little of both.
I will take a chance.
go for it.
it is like a to-do list, but for my life.
so what else is on this list?
it is private.
you want to tell me...
get very wasted. lose your virginity --
spend a year in the peace corps. make a medical discovery --
ambitious.
like you would know.
i do know.  be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
no problem --
and you have to meet my father.
you are in the play?
lead man.
I will get something for us to drink --
do not bother!
apropos of nothing... so. so so so so --
let's get something straight. you do not know me. i do not know you. but i know what you are about.  keep your distance from this house -- and from jamie.
the carter boy. tell me about him.
he wants help with his lines --
by accident --
jamie, he is careless. reckless.  is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I am supposed to always be alone?
i do not want you to see him outside school activities.
fine. but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I am sorry your mother is not here to help you become a woman.
dad, I have become a woman without her. just not a pretty one.
i know. do not say anything.
he is a softy. got him wrapped around my finger.
you think so.
know so.
because i try to be nice to people?
yeah. maybe. i dunno.
do you think I am strange?
cuz it is dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
the world of the dead?
could be...
what is that?
that is my telescope.
saturn. beautiful.
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
but there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
or building blocks for a world that never formed.
looking for intelligent life?
looking for something -- someone.
do you believe you will see your mother again?
i hope so.  i think maybe she sees me now.
I am building a larger one to see the nucleus of haley's comet --
the dirty snowball at its core.
yeah.  I am probably not going to be around next time it comes.
in 76 years, me neither.
you are really into god, right?
in ten words or less?
yeah.
my relationship with god is my own.
but you think about him -- it -- her.
do not you?
like in a church painting. i see this giant hovering over the ground. he is wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he is pointing his finger at something.
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
no.
i know there is a plan for everyone, but sometimes i do not understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
there is no point. you live. you die. the end.
you have to believe to have faith.
you do not believe in anything?
the bible. why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
interpreted by another guy like my father.
your father does not like me.
he does not trust you.
sometimes i do not even trust me.
deranged.
demented.
she is coming over here...
heart be still.
the play's going to be really good.
I am really glad you think so.
that is one girl who can not take a hint.
because she does not know what a hint is.
you are not in a very good mood.
you do not miss a thing.
the play's in a couple of weeks.
yes. and?
oh. just not at school...
yeah --
or anywhere where people might see us.
belinda's a very jealous person.
that would be the reason.
so it is like you want to be secret friends.
that is it! exactly! you are reading my mind --
then maybe you can read mine.
am i at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
yeah.
are you?
so what did we just make?
a similar triangle?
what else? what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
scalene?
okay. make me an isosceles.
she is like some puritan.
she is not. she is got her own ideas.
belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
it was.
and that you are scamming on jamie sullivan.
scamming's a strong word.
he okay?
healthy as can be.
you were great the other night.
thank you. so were you.
i have not been nice to you.
you are hardly nice to anyone.
landon!
later.
people can see.
and that would ruin your reputation how?
maybe you inspire me.
that sounds like horseshit.
all of it.
it is not.
prove it.
okay. maybe some of that is true --
you do not know the first thing about being someone is friend --
i do not want to be just your friend --
you do not know what you want --
you do not either. take a look at yourself. maybe you are scared that someone might actually like you --
and why would that scare me?
because then you could not hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your god.
out with belinda?
that is over. way over.
i can not know things if you do not tell me.
you saw him?
we talked. he wanted to get a bite -- after. i said no.
after he moved out, i invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. he did not show, not once.
he wants to show now.
you going to let him? you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
it is a start.
yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
so you are talking to me?
when i have something to say.
what does that mean?!
it means you can do anything.
you look nice. i should have dressed.
you are fine like that, mom.
there is hot cider in the kitchen.
thanks.
i have not seen clay or eric lately.
me neither.
to see your father?
no. i will not be long.
what is landon carter up to?
up to?
i thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
did you give him a gift?
no.
i saw the way he looked at you. the way he kissed you.
it was a play.
boys like him have -- expectations.
i have expectations, too.
who are you?
landon carter. i was driving the car that --
you.
me.
I am very sorry --
what kind of a man are you, son?
get yourself a glass.
no. thanks. gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
for jefferson high. for books.
where did you get -- ?
it is mine to give. i did not steal it.
i did not say you did.
hey.
i heard what you did. thank you.
she great or what?
why are you doing all this? to impress me?
no.  but are you -- impressed?
like fire.
what?
you.
yes. but not as a date date.
why not?
I am not allowed to date.
reverend sullivan. can i ask you something?
does it have to do with jamie?
yes, sir.
I would like to take jamie to dinner on new year's eve.
that will not be possible.
i care for her.
i do not want to see her hurt.
this week.
ever again.
your grades for fall semester. they are -- good.
you came here to give me my report card?
I have seen students with records like yours go to j.c. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
I would gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
thank you.
you are welcome.
i can not believe you asked my father's permission.
i wanted this to be a date.
is there a rush?
i have to get you home by one.
it is only 7:30.
we are going somewhere. after. and no. i did not ask your father.
your turn.
no.
i know you want to.
before we do this.
we are doing something -- ?
before we do this, i just want to say that a good life's got to be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
it is about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
what are you talking about?
excuse me?
fun.
the cells in our bodies are always changing. in six or seven years all your cells have changed. you could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
that what is happening to you, only faster?
stand right here.
where?
you are acting like a crazy person.
you are straddling the state line. you are in two places at once.
it is places like this that make me certain there is a god.
you are sometimes not sure?
I am sure. pretty sure.
we can measure wind.
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
what do you actually know with religion?
wonder. beauty. joy.  love.
i do not understand...
maybe you are not supposed to.
i might do it wrong.
not possible.
you make me feel...
loved?
that. and less strange.
assholes. this happen to you?
twice a year.
what is wr--?
the challenger exploded. principal kelly's about to make an announcement.
come on.
where?
away from here.
how do you know this place?
before the divorce. my father used to take me here. fire spotting was his summer job.
from here he proved to me the earth is not flat.  on rainy days, we would be above the clouds.
what would you do up here?
look. talk. not talk.
what did you tell your father?
the truth. i just left you out of it.
when did you build this?
i was twelve.
it is an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
where is the one you are building?
in my back yard.  i lied before. it is hardly started. but when it is done, it will have twice the power of this one --
so what do you want to see?
mars.
mars does not rise until 2:30
a thermos of hot coffee. a blanket. socks.
you planned this --
hoped for it.
are you trying to seduce me?
no. why? are you seducible?
ergo?
what about your father?
I am always home by midnight and he is always asleep.
what is the best thing i can see tonight?
me.
can you locate xxi5639i?
sure.
here. why am i looking at this star?
because i had it named for you. i know it is not an official designation --
a late night or an early morning?
late night.  you?
were you with jamie?
yeah.
you sleeping with her?
honey, some of this is... farfetched. you take after me. people skills and common sense. good dependable qualities.
i could take after dad, too.
you do. you are handsome and charming.
i meant he is a doctor.
that is eight years of school and training -- after college. and all that does not necessarily make you a better human being.
i could do it if i tried. even kelly thinks so.
that would be something.
but if it does not happen, grab for something within reach. life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
whatever my life is, I am going to be friggin' sure I am never disappointed --
have i told you how proud i am of you -- ?
mom, great. but what i want is for me to be proud of me.
landon. you are not the quiet type.
no.
so talk to us about something.
like what, sir?
you decide.
how about your family?
okay. sure.  my grandfather. when he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken president lincoln's hand.  made a big impression on him.
we did not tell him any different for years --
your parents are divorced?
since i was five. my mom's a cocktail waitress.
how do you -- the two of you -- get by?
materially or spiritually?
either. both.
I am asking how much.
dad --
it is time to tell him.  it would be the right thing.
maybe. but that is not the real reason. you think if i tell, he will disappear and that is what you want! me all to yourself!
no. i want what is best for you.
this -- him -- landon -- is what is best for me!
from citizen high to citizen low.
i do not care.
care, but just do not let it get to you. it gives them power.
that what you do?
yes. i try to keep my power.
one of your secrets.
yes, one of many.
you are worried about your college applications.
I am not applying to college.
you are going to take a year off? join the peace corps -- ?
no.
what are you going to -- ?
pull over.
where? why?
jamie --
I am sick.
then I will take you home. you will feel better tomorrow.
why did not you tell me?
the doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  i did not want anyone being -- weird around me.
it is her decision and she is decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
how -- how long does she have?
her doctors have. jamie and i. we are still praying for a miracle.
praying.
landon. we have lived with this for over a year now and --
if there is a god, how could he let this happen??!!
I am sorry. i did not know.
i did not know either.
i told him to leave me alone.
landon --
it was the only thing I have ever asked him!
no you didn't.  but he did change. just not enough.
jamie, you are not mad at me. you are mad at landon --
i am mad at you! and at landon! and the universe! and god!  i do not even know where to put all my anger.
that is normal. god accepts your anger. he will not punish you.
by making me ill, he is punishing me!  i just do not know what for.
i have no idea what to say. how to act. what if i do the wrong thing?
be yourself and i do not think there is a wrong thing.  let jamie take the lead. she will let you know what she needs.
I am so sorry. I am a coward --
i should have told you sooner --
i made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
no. the drugs just stopped working. if anything, doing things i love kept me healthy longer.
are you frightened?
all the time.  i feel like i have no one.
help me live until i die?
i will.
nope.
anything you want.
nothing.
slim jim? apple? yogurt? you like yogurt.
i used to like yogurt.
what are you thinking?
that i want you to take me home.
now? we just --
i do not want to come here anymore.
I have talked to your father.
that is what i mean.
whatever you need. whatever jamie needs. I am here.  i could start by driving her to school --
I am not going back to school.
say nothing. nothing 'bout her.
no. hey. we are sorry, man!
you know how to waltz??
i was going to fake it.
how you doing?
tired.
landon. you go on home.
I am not tired.
i need to be with her.
when mom died you told me god wanted her more, loved her more --
i was wrong. nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. not even god.
she asleep?
I will tell her you were here.
pictures from the play. jamie looks pretty --
I am sorry about how we --
no. you are with who you should be. it is like she chose you.
and i have no idea why.
i do.
'what is a friend? a single soul dwelling in two bodies.' aristotle.
lower. same page.
'find out who you are and do it on purpose.' dolly parton.
'love is always patient and kind. it is never boastful or conceited -- '
that was read at my parents' wedding.
how're you doing?
better. i was really angry.
it is gone now.
because you have hope that you will get better?
no.  maybe i believe god has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself.  maybe i believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
I will talk to your father.
it is not that simple.  it costs money to do this at home.
what are you doing here?
he wants to talk to you.
now it is okay?
landon. you have two parents. we are both here for you even --
everything's being done but it is not enough. i have to find something -- more.
landon, honey. there is nothing more.
I have almost finished the rocker. did she order mirrors?
in there.
you have materials for the side bearings?
I am using an old phonographic turntable.
for the focuser?
you know about this stuff?
i helped jamie with the first one.
i thought she built it herself.
she did. but hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
can i -- go out?
you will be fine for a few minutes.
will you do something for me?
landon. i can not even do for myself.
but if you could, you would?
yes.
you have been well?
yes. you?
getting by.
you are marrying again.
yes.
jamie wanted that. she told me.
I am sorry she never got her miracle.
she did. it was you.
