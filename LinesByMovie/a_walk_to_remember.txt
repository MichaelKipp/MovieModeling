where is he? he's supposed to be here.
i need to whizz.
so go dance.
with you.
i. don't. dance.
i'm thinking.
no thinking. the doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
hypotheticals --
i'm just wondering --
don't call him a dipshit.
you do --
and you don't.  what's she doing in there?
the address?!
york ave.
what if they expel you?
kelly wouldn't do that.
why not?
cuz nothing happened at school.
like you'd make it to june. even cutting half your classes, you have a b- average.
i'm no dummy.
that's right. you just act like one.
now i can do what i want.
that's right.  the world is your oyster.
i'm not hanging. i'm fixing my car --
you don't need a car you can't drive for a month. go see marvin.
'bout what?
about a job.
finding the real world to your liking, mr. carter?
i want to come back.
you could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
i'd do that --
how would you do that, mr. carter?
shall i give you a few ideas?
please.
besides attending all your regular classes, i'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
for pay?
for the inner satisfaction it will bring.  saturday mornings, i'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
i'm as underprivileged as they are --
finally, i'd like you to join the drama club. rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings.
i'd work backstage or something?
or something. they're doing a play for the holidays.
when do i get time for me?
you don't. that's the point.
landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  some of us remember how your father --
then you remember more than i do.
your father dropped off an extra check.
i don't want his money.
it could help with a new car --
-- i like the car i have.
he goes to my father's church. he could've died --
-- this your idea of small talk?
i don't make small talk --
-- obviously.
because, growing up, books were my world.
were?
you don't know me.
your book and your brown sweater and your hair. what's more to know -- ?
-- i wear the sweater because i'm cold. i read because no one talks to me. my hair is my hair. what is it exactly that's bothering you?
you mean care what you say? i'm worrying about other things.
like what? the moons of jupiter?
can't you have a normal conversation?
i don't want to have any conversation.
good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
'i hope your dreams come true.'
'they won't.'
'believe in yourself and they will. let me ask you, lizzie. look in the mirror? are you pretty --?'
'is it really me?'
'yes. you're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
no way. no thanks. i can't do it --
-- you can and you will, mr. carter.
you're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
-- this play means a lot to me.
this play -- ?
-- i know you don't suck at acting.
that's deep --
-- your act only works with an audience.
my act?!
i know you don't want help.
then we both know.  i'll point. you drive. faster.
yeah.
why?
because that's where the fire is?
fire is like a living thing. wild. unpredictable.
like me.
no. not like you.
what the -- ?!
so you agree you need help?
what's with the friggin numbers?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
i'm an enemy?
kinda. yeah.
the reason i got the part... i'm a little like lizzie. except i don't worry about some man rescuing me.
good thing.
you got some kind of list?
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
maybe a little of both.
i'll take a chance.
go for it.
it's like a to-do list, but for my life.
so what else is on this list?
it's private.
you want to tell me...
get very wasted. lose your virginity --
spend a year in the peace corps. make a medical discovery --
ambitious.
like you'd know.
i do know.  be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
no problem --
and you have to meet my father.
you're in the play?
lead man.
i'll get something for us to drink --
don't bother!
apropos of nothing... so. so so so so --
let's get something straight. you don't know me. i don't know you. but i know what you're about.  keep your distance from this house -- and from jamie.
the carter boy. tell me about him.
he wants help with his lines --
by accident --
jamie, he's careless. reckless.  is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
i'm supposed to always be alone?
i don't want you to see him outside school activities.
fine. but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
i'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
dad, i've become a woman without her. just not a pretty one.
i know. don't say anything.
he's a softy. got him wrapped around my finger.
you think so.
know so.
because i try to be nice to people?
yeah. maybe. i dunno.
do you think i'm strange?
cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
the world of the dead?
could be...
what is that?
that is my telescope.
saturn. beautiful.
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
but there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
or building blocks for a world that never formed.
looking for intelligent life?
looking for something -- someone.
do you believe you'll see your mother again?
i hope so.  i think maybe she sees me now.
i'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of haley's comet --
the dirty snowball at its core.
yeah.  i'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
in 76 years, me neither.
you're really into god, right?
in ten words or less?
yeah.
my relationship with god is my own.
but you think about him -- it -- her.
don't you?
like in a church painting. i see this giant hovering over the ground. he's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
no.
i know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes i don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
there is no point. you live. you die. the end.
you have to believe to have faith.
you don't believe in anything?
the bible. why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
interpreted by another guy like my father.
your father doesn't like me.
he doesn't trust you.
sometimes i don't even trust me.
deranged.
demented.
she's coming over here...
heart be still.
the play's going to be really good.
i'm really glad you think so.
that's one girl who can't take a hint.
because she doesn't know what a hint is.
you're not in a very good mood.
you don't miss a thing.
the play's in a couple of weeks.
yes. and?
oh. just not at school...
yeah --
or anywhere where people might see us.
belinda's a very jealous person.
that would be the reason.
so it's like you want to be secret friends.
that's it! exactly! you're reading my mind --
then maybe you can read mine.
am i at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
yeah.
are you?
so what did we just make?
a similar triangle?
what else? what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
scalene?
okay. make me an isosceles.
she's like some puritan.
she's not. she's got her own ideas.
belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
it was.
and that you're scamming on jamie sullivan.
scamming's a strong word.
he okay?
healthy as can be.
you were great the other night.
thank you. so were you.
i haven't been nice to you.
you're hardly nice to anyone.
landon!
later.
people can see.
and that would ruin your reputation how?
maybe you inspire me.
that sounds like horseshit.
all of it.
it's not.
prove it.
okay. maybe some of that is true --
you don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
i don't want to be just your friend --
you don't know what you want --
you don't either. take a look at yourself. maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
and why would that scare me?
because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your god.
out with belinda?
that's over. way over.
i can't know things if you don't tell me.
you saw him?
we talked. he wanted to get a bite -- after. i said no.
after he moved out, i invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. he didn't show, not once.
he wants to show now.
you going to let him? you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
it's a start.
yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
so you're talking to me?
when i have something to say.
what does that mean?!
it means you can do anything.
you look nice. i should have dressed.
you're fine like that, mom.
there's hot cider in the kitchen.
thanks.
i haven't seen clay or eric lately.
me neither.
to see your father?
no. i won't be long.
what's landon carter up to?
up to?
i thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
did you give him a gift?
no.
i saw the way he looked at you. the way he kissed you.
it was a play.
boys like him have -- expectations.
i have expectations, too.
who are you?
landon carter. i was driving the car that --
you.
me.
i'm very sorry --
what kind of a man are you, son?
get yourself a glass.
no. thanks. gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
for jefferson high. for books.
where did you get -- ?
it's mine to give. i didn't steal it.
i didn't say you did.
hey.
i heard what you did. thank you.
she great or what?
why are you doing all this? to impress me?
no.  but are you -- impressed?
like fire.
what?
you.
yes. but not as a date date.
why not?
i'm not allowed to date.
reverend sullivan. can i ask you something?
does it have to do with jamie?
yes, sir.
i'd like to take jamie to dinner on new year's eve.
that won't be possible.
i care for her.
i don't want to see her hurt.
this week.
ever again.
your grades for fall semester. they're -- good.
you came here to give me my report card?
i've seen students with records like yours go to j.c. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
i'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
thank you.
you're welcome.
i can't believe you asked my father's permission.
i wanted this to be a date.
is there a rush?
i have to get you home by one.
it's only 7:30.
we're going somewhere. after. and no. i didn't ask your father.
your turn.
no.
i know you want to.
before we do this.
we're doing something -- ?
before we do this, i just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
it's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
what are you talking about?
excuse me?
fun.
the cells in our bodies are always changing. in six or seven years all your cells have changed. you could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
that what's happening to you, only faster?
stand right here.
where?
you're acting like a crazy person.
you're straddling the state line. you're in two places at once.
it's places like this that make me certain there's a god.
you're sometimes not sure?
i'm sure. pretty sure.
we can measure wind.
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
what do you actually know with religion?
wonder. beauty. joy.  love.
i don't understand...
maybe you're not supposed to.
i might do it wrong.
not possible.
you make me feel...
loved?
that. and less strange.
assholes. this happen to you?
twice a year.
what's wr--?
the challenger exploded. principal kelly's about to make an announcement.
come on.
where?
away from here.
how do you know this place?
before the divorce. my father used to take me here. fire spotting was his summer job.
from here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  on rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
what would you do up here?
look. talk. not talk.
what'd you tell your father?
the truth. i just left you out of it.
when did you build this?
i was twelve.
it's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
where's the one you're building?
in my back yard.  i lied before. it's hardly started. but when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
so what do you want to see?
mars.
mars doesn't rise until 2:30
a thermos of hot coffee. a blanket. socks.
you planned this --
hoped for it.
are you trying to seduce me?
no. why? are you seducible?
ergo?
what about your father?
i'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
what's the best thing i can see tonight?
me.
can you locate xxi5639i?
sure.
here. why am i looking at this star?
because i had it named for you. i know it's not an official designation --
a late night or an early morning?
late night.  you?
were you with jamie?
yeah.
you sleeping with her?
honey, some of this is... farfetched. you take after me. people skills and common sense. good dependable qualities.
i could take after dad, too.
you do. you're handsome and charming.
i meant he's a doctor.
that's eight years of school and training -- after college. and all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
i could do it if i tried. even kelly thinks so.
that'd be something.
but if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
whatever my life is, i'm going to be friggin' sure i'm never disappointed --
have i told you how proud i am of you -- ?
mom, great. but what i want is for me to be proud of me.
landon. you're not the quiet type.
no.
so talk to us about something.
like what, sir?
you decide.
how about your family?
okay. sure.  my grandfather. when he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken president lincoln's hand.  made a big impression on him.
we didn't tell him any different for years --
your parents are divorced?
since i was five. my mom's a cocktail waitress.
how do you -- the two of you -- get by?
materially or spiritually?
either. both.
i'm asking how much.
dad --
it's time to tell him.  it would be the right thing.
maybe. but that's not the real reason. you think if i tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! me all to yourself!
no. i want what's best for you.
this -- him -- landon -- is what's best for me!
from citizen high to citizen low.
i don't care.
care, but just don't let it get to you. it gives them power.
that what you do?
yes. i try to keep my power.
one of your secrets.
yes, one of many.
you're worried about your college applications.
i'm not applying to college.
you're going to take a year off? join the peace corps -- ?
no.
what are you going to -- ?
pull over.
where? why?
jamie --
i'm sick.
then i'll take you home. you'll feel better tomorrow.
why didn't you tell me?
the doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  i didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
it's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
how -- how long does she have?
her doctors have. jamie and i. we're still praying for a miracle.
praying.
landon. we've lived with this for over a year now and --
if there is a god, how could he let this happen??!!
i'm sorry. i didn't know.
i didn't know either.
i told him to leave me alone.
landon --
it was the only thing i've ever asked him!
no you didn't.  but he did change. just not enough.
jamie, you're not mad at me. you're mad at landon --
i am mad at you! and at landon! and the universe! and god!  i don't even know where to put all my anger.
that's normal. god accepts your anger. he won't punish you.
by making me ill, he is punishing me!  i just don't know what for.
i have no idea what to say. how to act. what if i do the wrong thing?
be yourself and i don't think there is a wrong thing.  let jamie take the lead. she'll let you know what she needs.
i'm so sorry. i'm a coward --
i should have told you sooner --
i made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
no. the drugs just stopped working. if anything, doing things i love kept me healthy longer.
are you frightened?
all the time.  i feel like i have no one.
help me live until i die?
i will.
nope.
anything you want.
nothing.
slim jim? apple? yogurt? you like yogurt.
i used to like yogurt.
what are you thinking?
that i want you to take me home.
now? we just --
i don't want to come here anymore.
i've talked to your father.
that's what i mean.
whatever you need. whatever jamie needs. i'm here.  i could start by driving her to school --
i'm not going back to school.
say nothing. nothing 'bout her.
no. hey. we're sorry, man!
you know how to waltz??
i was going to fake it.
how you doing?
tired.
landon. you go on home.
i'm not tired.
i need to be with her.
when mom died you told me god wanted her more, loved her more --
i was wrong. nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. not even god.
she asleep?
i'll tell her you were here.
pictures from the play. jamie looks pretty --
i'm sorry about how we --
no. you're with who you should be. it's like she chose you.
and i have no idea why.
i do.
'what is a friend? a single soul dwelling in two bodies.' aristotle.
lower. same page.
'find out who you are and do it on purpose.' dolly parton.
'love is always patient and kind. it is never boastful or conceited -- '
that was read at my parents' wedding.
how're you doing?
better. i was really angry.
it's gone now.
because you have hope that you'll get better?
no.  maybe i believe god has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself.  maybe i believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
i'll talk to your father.
it's not that simple.  it costs money to do this at home.
what are you doing here?
he wants to talk to you.
now it's okay?
landon. you have two parents. we're both here for you even --
everything's being done but it's not enough. i have to find something -- more.
landon, honey. there's nothing more.
i've almost finished the rocker. did she order mirrors?
in there.
you have materials for the side bearings?
i'm using an old phonographic turntable.
for the focuser?
you know about this stuff?
i helped jamie with the first one.
i thought she built it herself.
she did. but hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
can i -- go out?
you'll be fine for a few minutes.
will you do something for me?
landon. i can't even do for myself.
but if you could, you would?
yes.
you've been well?
yes. you?
getting by.
you're marrying again.
yes.
jamie wanted that. she told me.
i'm sorry she never got her miracle.
she did. it was you.
