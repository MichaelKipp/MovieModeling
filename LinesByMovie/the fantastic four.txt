good thing it ain't workin... reed, what are we doing here?  this guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
this wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot nasa.  and victor's not that bad.  he's just a little...  larger than life.
he's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
you'd never know it.
but dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  same old reed, the hopeless optimist. still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
you remember in school we talked about working together.  that's what i was about to explain...
i can't take this.
ben.  this is business.  just work.
it's just business.
i think you both know my director of genetic research, susan storm.
you're, you've, i mean, how have you bee--
never better.
this isn't going to be a problem, is it?
not at all.
you back this mission, and i'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
the number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  and it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
what about his first born?
ben, the money's not important.  we could <u>save lives</u>.
funny how things turn out, isn't it?
hilarious.
if reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
and if he's not...?
reed's <u>always</u> right.  good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
he <u>knew</u> about nasa.  what if he made the call to shut us down --
ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  you always let this guy push you round --
we got what we wanted.  that's <u>enough</u>.
i know, i know.  i'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... speaking of which...
those solar winds are flaring, but i factored them into my coordinates and --
i was talking about us.  working together.
well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and i'll focus on the molecular physics.  or, uhm, maybe i should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
right.  that's exactly what i meant.
way to not overthink it.  so when do we leave?
i'll schedule the launch.  call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
i, uh, think i remember the number.
it's been changed.
as far as crew, i was hoping ben could pilot the mission --
well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  you remember my brother johnny...
can't do it.  i cannot do it.
external srbs, orbital system engines. its just like the shuttles you flew in --
no.  i cannot take orders from that underwear model.  that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
youthful high spirits.
they crashed it into a wall.  a flight <i>simulator</i>.
i'm sure he's matured since then.
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
five times.
i had it at four.
this makes five.
i can handle the ship.  i can even handle mr. blonde ambition.  but i don't know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits.  who the hell came up with them?
victor did.
the synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  i've been working on a formula for this.
great minds think alike.
they're ready for you, sir.
showtime.
our numbers are through the roof.  the ipo's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  the bank's five times oversubscribed --
it's not just the money.  i could make money in my sleep.
then what is it?
history, leonard.  <u>history</u>. everything else is conversation...  how's the other matter?
isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
he's made a few changes.
this is your dream, reed.  you should be the one up there.
victor's better at these things.
i'll be watching over you.
just get back soon, or i start looking for a new groom.
soon as i'm back, i'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
i don't care about rocks, i care about <u>you</u>.  you bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being best man.
what the hell you smiling at?  just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those smbs --
actually, the engines are smes. hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. couple generations past your last ride.  i'm not as dumb as you look.
if you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
leonard, how's the feed?
recording, sir.  we see you perfectly.
we can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
is it safe?
the shields on the station should protect us.
<u>should</u>?
got it.  so take a walk, ben...i'm going to borrow susan for a second.
sure.
please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'course not.  strictly business.
yeah, well, his eyes say different.
hey, two hearts got busted last time. maybe she's not over it either.
let's see: you got victor, stud of the year, more coin than god?  or reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  hmmm, it's a toss-up.
put your tiny little mind at ease.
don't you wander off, boy.
surprised i agreed to reed's proposal?
i understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
it's been a good two years, victor... the company's accomplished so much.
right, of course, the company... but you see, i've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
uh, victor, i hope i haven't done something to make you think...
sue, i've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  and this is the biggest step yet.  if it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  a merger of sorts...  four little words that can change our lives...
we've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  we need to abort.
get a grip.  reed.  we didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  just close the shields...
ben's still out there --
so reel him in.  but we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  so let's do it.  <u>quickly</u>.
i ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
ben.  this is serious.  <u>turn around</u>.
come on, ben, come on...
reed, we're running out of time.
not until ben is back inside!
it's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
what are you doing?
raising the shields.
you can't leave them out there.
victor's right.  johnny, get to the command center.  close the shields.
what about you?
he's not responsive --
ben!  ben!
where...where am i?
back on earth.  victor's medical facility... we're in quarantine.
reed? ... sue?
they're fine.  everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
what's wrong with me?
i swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  the best plastic surgeons in the world, ben.  you had the best --
give me a mirror...
they said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
give me the god damn mirror!
and where do we think we're going?
i don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
you're hot!
so are you!
i mean, you feel a little feverish.
i've never felt better in my life. when do you get off work?
my shift ends at four, but i couldn't --
meet me at 4:01, top of the run. that'll give you a minute to freshen up.
how long was i out?
three days.  i was worried about you. how are you feeling?
solid.
i don't know.  i just keep going over and over the numbers.
reed.  even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
i should have done more, run more tests --
you go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
yeah, you and debbie and perfect --
reed, i'm not talking about debbie.
what?  come on.  she's got a good thing with victor --
i'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
he's smart, powerful, successful --
well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
me like-y.
stay right.  left is trouble.
i though we went over this.
last one down springs for room service.
you're on fire!
not this again --
no: you're <u>on fire</u>!
how's the ipo?
stable.  we're looking at low twenties.  it's a good number, considering the fallout from --
reed's disaster.  you know, i half- think he did this to me on purpose.
sir, i'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
get me on the am shows, larry king, cover of the journal...  i've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  make sure they only shoot my right side.
actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
and that's a <u>good</u> thing?
you know, maybe you should get some rest --
later.  first, i've got some unfinished business.  a deal that needs closing...
sir, i've always wondered... why <u>sue</u>? you could have any woman in the world but --
<u>that's</u> why.  because i could have any <u>other</u> woman... you know, when they asked caesar "why england," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
i can only stay for one drink, ben. i've got to meet with victor.
wouldn't want to keep vic waiting.
are you alright?
i think i need to lie down.  bad shrimp.
feeling better?
yes, thanks.
that's good.  that's uh...good.
you always had a way with words.  i should be getting back.
you're <u>happy</u> for me and victor.
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
which was?
passion.
for science.
you are such a dork, reed... you never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
uh, sue...?  i <u>can't</u>.
what?  what do you mean you --
sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
it has to be the cloud.  it's fundamentally altered our dna.
let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
now what is up with <i>that</i>?
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna.
cool.  what'd it do to you guys?
apparently i can disappear.
<u>please</u> tell me you go silent too.
flame on, flame off.  flame on, flame off --
johnny.
stop it.
okay, "mom."
oh, you dawg you.  better not be my nurse!
ben, are you there?
what is that <i>thing</i>?
i think that thing is ben.
what's going on?
victor, are you feeling alright?
just a little banged up.  a couple scrapes.  why?
ben did this.
<u>ben</u> did this?
he's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  and he's not the only one.
victor, i'm sorry i --
just <u>find</u> him.
deb... it's me.  i need you to step out front.
out front?  you home, baby?  i got a surprise for you.
ben?
don't come any closer for a sec.  this is gonna be kind of a shock... you remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
baby, you're scaring me.
oh my g-g-g.  what did you...do to ben?
deb, it's me.  it's still me.
make sure you find ben, bring him back here.  and keep it quiet.  i don't need this to hit the press.
yes sir.  you've got the mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the journal --
front page?
top left, like you asked.  today wall street.  tomorrow, who knows...maybe washington.
what?
we need to get past them.
sue.  your clothes.  lose them.
what...?  <u>oh</u>.
this is wrong in so many ways.
you've been working out.
what the --!
ben.  are you okay?
am <u>i</u> okay?!  you wanna explain that?!
ben grimm is a genuine american hero who's been through a terrible orde--
what he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
we had a tough year.
yeah, nine years straight.
twenty?  from outside the place looks a lot taller.
oh, it is.
how come ben can't turn it on and off like us?
that's what we're here to find out.
if it happened to him, then it could...
wait.  you mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
grow up, johnny.  you want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
is that a trick question?  c'mon, i can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
this place is deluxe.  you got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. let me show you to your rooms.
victor, your scar --
i told you, i'm fine.  it's <u>you</u> i'm worried about.
i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to --
please, no apologies.  i've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  you'll have round-the clock care.
i'm starting to wonder the same thing... how much do you know about what happened to you?
not much.  we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  it was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  you ruined the lives of four people --
<u>i</u> ruined?  with all due respect, i told you to abort --
<u>abort</u>?  reed, i put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and i will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
i don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  this isn't one of your science projects.  i just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>fast</u>!
you got a chisel round here?
if we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes.
we need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
well why didn't you say so?  you want me to lift some weights or something?
back it down, johnny!
i can go hotter!
you're really cramping my style here.
you were at 4000 kelvin.  any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
sweet.
that's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
gotcha.  okay.  supernova bad.
okay.  i've uh, got some questions, from sue.  that she thought might be better coming from me... can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
yeah.  you don't wanna know the details.
ben, i'm afraid i've got to ask --
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
o-kay.  we'll skip that question.
is there something about flames? about flaming, that you --
what are you trying to say?  just because i dress well and like to dance --
what?  no.  i'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
oh, well that's easy: i'm hot. you're...well, you're a little limp. sue's easy to see through.  and ben's always been a hardass.  why aren't you writing this down?
it's not "invisibility" per se. you're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  that's what you projected on the bridge.
what about you?  you haven't eaten in days.  how come you're never on this side of the microscope?
you should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
excuse me?
i'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  can you remember the exact emotions when --
anger.  rage.  frustration.
okay.  is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  some memory or...
i'm sure i can come up with something.
i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
what in the world would give me that idea?
i mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
are you kidding?
no, i distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  ergo...
reed.  i was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, i walked.
i think it was a little more complicated than --
i just wanted to share an apartment. what was so complicated about that?
there were a lot of variables to consider --
no.  there weren't.  there was <u>you</u>. and <u>me</u>.  no variables, no math.  it was actually the simplest thing in the world.  but your head got in the way... like it always does.
you look like an eighties rock band.
the suit will stretch.  you should try it --
i wouldn't be caught dead in that.
he's right.  these costumes are... missing something.  i can't put my finger on it --
they're not costumes.
your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. every system is still functioning, somehow --
and they're changing into...
i don't really know.  a compound organic-metallic alloy.  stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  harder than diamonds --
like the shields reed said would protect us.  how long?
at this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
what do you mean "complete"?
i wish i could tell you.  i can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  i'll notify the cdc and --
what?
the center for disease control.  if this thing is contagious --
but...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
that's terrible news...
what are you doing?
the plants, from space.  their particles are still charged.  with the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
if we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
and reverse the mutations --
curing countless diseases, not just ours.
but <u>we're</u> the focus, right reed? <u>reed</u>...?
of course.  of course.
and you sure you can control this thing?  last time didn't work out so well.
with the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  maybe tie into the city grid...
what did you wish for, honey?
i already got it.  everything i want.
that's what i'm trying to calculate. and it's not rubber.  it's muscle, tendon.  i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
right, whatever, have fun.
i don't think she's real big on hate.
you wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
such a sad face... you know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
trust me, this ain't one of those times.
you said it was urgent.
it is.  there's something we need to talk about.  something i need to ask you...
victor, wait, slow down a second.  i want you to know i appreciate everything you've done for me, but i just don't --
susan.  what are you doing?
he's working round the clock.  but the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
same old reed.  all analysis, no action.  wasn't that the problem with you two?
if these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
then why is reed dragging his feet? maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  it's ironic, isn't it?  you're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
please don't make this personal --
oh, i think you already have.
victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
reed.  how close are we to a cure?
no way to know.  without more tests, experiments.
he didn't.
oh, he did.
<u>what</u> did he do to the uniform?!
uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the invisible girl.
<u>girl</u>...?!
i'm driving.
dude.  that's my sister.
you're gonna pay for that, pebbles.  what?!
you gave us <u>names</u>?  what are you, the "face" of the fantastic four now?
it's about to be a broken face.
this isn't permanent, johnny.  we need to be careful until we're normal again.
you two need a time-out.
blockhead started it!
you need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
act.  here we go again.  reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  what if we have some, you know...like, calling?
a higher calling like getting girls and making money?
he didn't mean it.  you know johnny. he's always been a hothead --
it's not him.  it's <u>them</u>.  i can't live like this.
just give reed a little more time. you know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
it's easy for you to be patient.
no, it's not.  i thought i was done waiting for reed... we're all in this together now, ben.
what are you doing here?
what i <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  applications and patents, reed. this all belongs to me.
but i'm not done with the machine --
which is precisely the <u>point</u>. analysis is over.  it's time for <u>action</u>.  my men could have mass- produced this by now.
don't let victor push you into making a mistake --
he was going to take away all my data, equipment --
better than your <u>life</u>.  victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>we</u> are.
which is why i'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  you don't eat, sleep.  you can't live in your head like --
<u>i'm</u> not the only one in there.  i got you, vic, ben, johnny, all rattling around in there.
how'd you know it was me?
i'm blind, not deaf.  wanna come in?
i'm not really dressed for a party.
relax, it's casual.
no, i mean...i'm a little...dusty...
those yours too?
my step-dad's.  i'm strictly into stone.  i was wondering when you'd walk by.
you know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
this ain't permanent.  my friend reed's working on a cure...i think.
you don't know what it's like out there.  walking around like some kind of circus freak.  people staring, whispering --
i wouldn't know anything about that.
i mean...
tell me.  when you grew up in brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  you went your own way then.  you didn't listen to people.  so why start now...?
i could get ben to tap into the baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
reed.  shh.  just be quiet.  and look up.
remember our first date here...?  god, i was so nervous.
you <u>were</u>?
of course i was.  i'd read all your papers on bioethics.  some of them two times just so i'd have something to say to you.
you know, i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
i gave him twenty.
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  one who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
i did.  i did, reed...but i wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
when i walked out, i waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  ten. waiting for you to come find me.
why didn't you say something?
that would have kinda defeated the purpose.  and reed...  i'm saying it now.
what are <u>you</u> doing here?
i'm worried about you.
about me?  how sweet.
come on.  let me buy you something to eat.  looks like you could use the company.
'scuse me.
i know it can't be easy.  life hasn't changed that much for reed, sue and johnny.  at least they can go out in public.  but for you?  people staring. whispering behind your back...
if you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
i'm just saying, i know what it's like to lose something you love.  to see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
reed's gonna fix me up --
for your sake i hope you're right. i'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
skeptical...?
ben --
oh, you remember my name do you?  you happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
we're working as hard as we can --
yeah.  i can tell.  victor was right.
glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
ben, i don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. i need you to be patient for a little while longe--
hey!  that's a <u>prototype</u>!
go back to the drawing board.
johnny?  did you see ben?
yeah, for the last time, i hope.  i'm done with this freak show.  i'm moving back to the real world.
is that what you call it?  "<i>real</i>"?
at least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
johnny, slow down.  <u>think</u>.  you know mom didn't raise us to --
look around, sis!  <u>she's not here</u>.  so you can stop talking to me like i'm your little boy --
as soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. you think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  you're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
i can...make it work.
reed, stop, you need to rest your --
the power...i need...more power...to control...the storm --
you <u>need</u> a doctor.
ben, come in.
what is this?  where's reed?
where do you <u>think</u>?  with <u>sue</u>.
what do you want, vic?
to help you.  i've run every test known to man.  and they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
reed said it'd be weeks till --
he <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  and we know how that turned out.
he couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. yet another mistake for "mr. fantastic."
and you can?  power it up?
i'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
no, <u>i'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
the machine works.  and vic's gone mister hyde on us --
really?  with a name like von <u>doom</u>? never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
<u>where is reed</u>?
victor must've taken him.
what are you doing --
sis.  let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
but johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
johnny.  supernova.
but all these people...
<u>now</u>.
sue, i need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
i'm sure i can come up with something.
time for <u>your</u> lesson, vic.  chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  ben...
got it, teach.
ben, i've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  i think if we can rework the power settings...
forget it, egghead.  i'm good as is.
we're going to have to work on your touch.
i like the sound of that.
i found a broken gasket, from space --
a <u>gasket</u>?  reed, we're at a party.
no more cracks about how i look.
hey, i'm mr. sensitivity now.  clear the way, wide load coming through.
