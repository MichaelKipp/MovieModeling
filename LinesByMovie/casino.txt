...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. i do not know all the details.
matter of fact...
but it is in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. except you got to do it right. i mean, you got to have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. otherwise you are talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. and who knows who is going to be comin' along in that time? before you know it, you got to dig a few more holes. you could be there all fuckin' night.
i hired an old casino pal, billy sherbert, as my manager and i went to work.
...and this is ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
for guys like me, las vegas washes away your sins. it is a morality car wash. it does for us what lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. and, along with making us legit...
you got a round figure on it?
definitely the most important guy in this room.
as far as the world was concerned andy stone, the head of the teamsters' pension fund, was a legitimate guy.
this is a very auspicious occasion.
a powerful man.
philip, if you would rise.
he even played golf with the president.
on behalf of the teamsters' pension fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
but andy also took orders. and when he was told to give a pension fund loan to philip green...
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new tangiers.
thank you.
...he did what he was told.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
you know, i do not know if i could do this even if i wanted to. the gaming commission would never give me a license. i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
you do not have to have a license to work in a casino. all you got to do is apply for one. the state law says you can work in a casino while they are processing your application. they got a ten-year backlog.
but what happens when they do find out?
why would they want to find out? we are puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. why would they want to lock us out?  and besides, they will never find out. all you got to do is keep changing your job title. like, uh, from casino executive to food and beverage chairman. and what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. i know guys workin' there for thirty years, do not have a license.
it is a tough proposition, andy. you, you know, if i did it, I would have to run it my way.
you got it.
I am serious. no interference.
nobody's going to interfere with your running the casino. i guarantee it.
you know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
where the hell did you learn how to deal?
he bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
place the checks properly. that is the way you do it.
I will take columbia for twenty.
if his girlfriend was knocked up.
but back then the bosses did not give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. to them, he was a cash register. all they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. especially remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
ma che cazzo!
i mean, unless ace made his bet.
that is enough now!
ace.
keepin' remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
son-of-a-bitch. how the hell did you get oklahoma-michigan?  nobody ever had oklahoma-mi... how the hell'd you do it?
well, that is why they paid so well.
you see?  never tells me nothin'. ace, what do we got on for next week?
well, it is a little too early. I would say thursday would be good. I will know by then. is that all right?
okay. you come by the house?
I will come by.
seven o'clock?
seven o'clock.
hey, nick. vien acca. [italian- american slang for 'come here']
I will be right out.
t'aggia parla. [italian-american slang for 'i've got to talk to you'] nicky... see that guy?
mm.
keep a good eye on him. he is makin' a lot of money for us. and he is going to continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
mm.
not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  okay?
all right.
uh-huh. mi raccomando. [italian- american slang for 'i'm counting on you']
yeah.
fine.
want me to take this for you?
yeah, we made a great pair. i made book and nicky made sure we always collected. the old men loved us. and why not? they all made money with us.
they payin'?
how did nicky collect?
it was eight.  ace... tell him the line on the bear's game.
eight.
if he do not know, nobody knows. told you it was eight.
well, how come i laid nine?
'cause you are a jag-off. i would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
excuse me.
what?
is this yours? your pen?
yeah, that is my pen. why?
i ju- well, it is a nice pen. i just did not know whose it was. i thought it was yours. i did not want it to get lost.
well, thank you. why do not you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
what is that? you hear? you hear a little girl, frankie? you hear a little girl, ace? is that a little fuckin' girl?!  what happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! huh?! huh?!
wait a sec, nicky, nicky, nicky. ta- take it easy.
while i was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', nicky just hit him. no matter how big a guy might be, nicky would take him on. you beat nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. you beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. and you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he will keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
listen...
it will not happen again, sam.
mr rothstein.
we need this guy.
we can not get rid of him?
he is juiced in. he is the county commissioner's cousin.
i would not give the bum a mop job.
hi, ace.
hello, senator.
hey, i need a room. need a room.
good to see ya.  william would you...
i had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
nice to see you, senator.
help the senator, give him whatever he wants.
certainly.  senator.
why not make them happy?
we have some nice penthouses you will enjoy. maybe the presidential suite.
yes!
thank you. very nice.
i told you i was hot tonight.
I am sorry.
oh, I am sorry. I am sorry.  thank you very much. thank you very much.
thank you, sir, i appreciate that. everybody, thanks. gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. thanks. take care, steve. take chances and drive fast.
ginger, honey.
come on.
what is the matter?
what do you mean, 'what's the matter?' i made a lot of money for you. i want my cut.
what money? I have seen you stealing from me.
what money?  look at this stack of chips. do not give me that shit. i want my end.
ginger, I have been watching you all night. you have been stealing from me.
do not give me that shit. i want my money.
that bag's full of fuckin' chips you
what do you mean 'stole'? i did not steal anything from you.
get lost, ginger! get lost!
get lost?
yes.
get lost?
yes.
well, how 'bout that?
come on!
I am going to go powder my nose.
ginger's mission in life was money.
I will be right back.
see you, ginger.
okay, thank you for asking.
she was a queen around the casino. she brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
hello.
any change?
i hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
that was all bullshit. she just pocketed the cash.
she took care of the dealers...
hey, mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
thank you.
but mostly...
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
thanks a lot.
but one thing i could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, lester diamond.
look, gin, you know i got other people in this. i got partners. but i want you to understand that i am lookin' out for you in this thing.  okay? you are going to get yours back... and you are going to get it back first. okay?
all right.
okay?
yeah.
where are you goin'? where are you? you are in that place. where are you?
I am here.
no, you are not. where are you? where are you?
I am always here for you.
you are.
i am.
the ginger i knew would not even look at this creep.
good luck.
yeah.
he was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. a scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
but nobody had to take care of nicky.
you find any cash in there, we will whack it up with you.
i mean, he took care of himself only too well. and that is why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
excuse me, but i folded these things beautifully and i would appreciate a little respect. jesus christ!
do not look at me, pal. i got to live with her.
even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
excuse me.
i mean, frank marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. this time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in antwerp.
oh, yes. will you help me fold these, please?
they were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
you go and put your things away.
and they were usually right.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
hold it, hold it. here.
because nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he did not give a damn who knew it.
come on. there we go. look at that. beautiful.
i mean, that is what worried me, 'cause it turns out nicky was about to be sent to vegas.
all right, we are clear.
there is more!
i think that is it.
there is more! there is a couple stuck in there. i know there is more.
god, I am telling you, they are out!
come on, damn it. do not get so defensive. it could be stuck in your hair, you know.
look, there aren't...  there are not but...
oh, there aren't?  what is that?  huh? what is that.  there is no more. thanks, hon.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
hey.
hey, how you doin'?
hey. hey, sammy, how are you?
wow.
boy, look at this place, huh?
incredible.
all right.
okay, sammy.
somethin', huh?
yeah.
ginger.
holy shit, what have you been doin' out here?
honey, come here.
this is jennifer and nick. they are dear friends of mine.
good to meet you.
hi, jennifer.
pleasure.  very nice to meet you.
hi, how are you?
okay, sammy.
after we ate, we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. and then... he hit me with it.
what do you think about me movin' out here?  what is the matter? you got a problem with that?
no, of course not.
you mean, i have your permission?
sure, you have my permission. but i - i just got to tell you it is no joke out here. it is no joke, you know? you got to keep a low profile. it is not like back home. right off the bat, they do not like guys like us. and this sheriff's a real cowboy. even the coppers are not afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
i do not care. i want to get away from back home for a while. I am tired of that shit back there.  look at this place. it is made of money. you know what the best part is? nobody's going to know what we are doin'! there is nobody here to see us! everybody's back home.
nick, i got to tell you, i got pinched twice for no reason. you really got to be careful. I am running a licensed place. everything's legit.
do not worry about it. I am not going to do anything. what am i going to do? I am especially not going to involve you in anything.
ace saw vegas one way.
you call this guy and tell him I am comin'?
of course.
but i saw it another. i saw it as untouched. i mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers i could shake down. who the fuck were they gonna run to?  so, i started getting everybody in line. best of all, for the first time in my life, i figured out a way not to lose.
yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. it was not very scientific but it worked. when he won, he collected. when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. what were they going to do? muscle nicky?  nicky was the muscle.
tony.
hey.
how you doin'?
how you doin'?
all right, yeah. you got that thing for me?
what thing? oh, nicky... i thought you was layin'.
i was layin'? no, no, I am taking it. i was takin' it.
you sure?
I am positive.
well, I am a little confused here.
you are a little confused?
yeah.
maybe if i stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you will - you will get unconfused. give me the fuckin' money!
I am sorry, nicky. i did not mean anything by it.
yeah, i know, that is why you had it ready. you thought i was fuckin' layin' it?!
my fuckin' head.
your fuckin' head, huh? do not fuck around, tony.
smarten up.
you jag-off.
beautiful. you got a beautiful swing.
ace got my son, little nicky, involved with little league, and it was great.
now, i want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'cause that is what is going to win this game.
turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
...metro intelligence cop. but it did not matter. i mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
you know, he is got to realize everything can not be a home run that he does.
yeah, well, that is exactly what i keep tellin' him, but that is the kind of kid he is ever since he is born.
it is instinctive, you know.
he tries to do everything...
ohh!
and, nicky being nicky, he made his presence known.
especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
me? that is why the bosses sent me out here. they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [eddy and jerry]. they were going to try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  yeah, right, I am sure.
hey, nicky, how are you? what are you doin' here?
I am over here now.
yeah, I am over here with him.
oh.
oh.
we are waiting on carmine.
yeah, we are lookin' for carmine.
carmine? he was here before. i saw him. he had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
carmine left?
uh-huh.
carmine left?
he is gone?
he is not here?
carmine's gone.
i think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. i do not know.
well, listen, uh... good luck with the joint, huh?
oh, thanks, eddy.
we had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
I am just curious. i saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. can you do that with both hands?
no.
can not do it with both hands?
no, sir.
can you do it with your left hand?
well, i... i never tried.
so, you are a righty?
ye-yeah.
now, you are going to have to learn with your left hand.
god!
hiya. that is a lot of money to be counting out in public.
yeah.
why do not i take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
hi.
having a good time?
yes, uh...
you will want to count the money in privacy. you know, you do not need...
uh, i have a plane to catch to cleveland...  can i get my winnings?
look what they did to my hand, man!
all right, I am going to give you a choice. you can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. you can not have both. what do you want?
i just wanna get out of here.
and do not forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. you understand?
I am sorry. i made a bad mistake.
you are fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we are going to break your fuckin' heads and you will not walk out of here. you see that fuckin' saw?  we are going to use it. you do not fuck around in this place. you got it?
yeah.
get out of here.
thank you.
within no time, everything was set in place. we got rid of the freelance scamsters. the per was way up.  the gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  and i, i decided to complicate my life. for a guy who likes sure things, i was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
we are not getting any younger. do not you think it is time? are not you gettin' tired of all this shit? bangin' around, hustlin' around?
what, are you trying to handicap me?
I am going to do you one better. I am trying to marry you. you want to marry me?  I am serious. i mean, i - i want to settle down. i want a family.
you got the wrong girl, sam.
i know I would be a good father. i know you would be a good mother.
you do not know me. what, you have known me, two, three months. what do you know?
I am forty-three years old. i do not want to wait. i know you well enough to know that i really love you very much.  and i can not think of anybody better to be with. and i do not feel like waiting anymore.
you know a lot of happily married people, sam? 'cause i don't.
yeah, i know all that.
i care about you, a - but i just do not have those kind of feelings for you. I am sorry. I am not in love with you.
i - i - i...
understand?  I am sorry.
no, i - i... mean...  that can grow as i - as long as there is a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I am realistic. i can accept that. but, you know, what is... what is love anyway?  it is a... it is a mutual respect. it is - it is a devotion. it is a... it is a caring from one person to another. and if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  i feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that i could live with that.
if it does not work out. you know, if it does not play out, then what happens to me?
you know I am doin' well now. and I am going to do even better. and so, whatever happens, if it does not work out between us, I am going to make sure you are okay for the rest of your life. and if there are kids, especially, you know, I will take care of you better than you would ever imagine.
what are you... what are you pitching me, here?
just what i said. you will be set up for the rest of your life. that i can promise you.  want to take a chance?
when i married ginger i knew all the stories, but i did not give a fuck. 'i'm sam rothstein,' i said. 'i can change her.'
it was typical ace. he invited the biggest people in town and he knew they would show. because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  with ace, nobody ever got a free ride. even ginger. with her -
do not make me come there. answer me.
i love you.
bub-ut, baby, do you know that i love you too?
no, lester.
do you know that?
yeah. this is the best thing i can do for my life right now.
that is right.
so, it is going to be okay, is not it?
promise?
god... i wish you...
...all the luck in the world.
you do?
yeah, i do. i mean, it is - it is the - it is the best thing you can do right now. i mean this. and you will have real security.  sweetheart... you are going to be situated just right in vegas.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
okay, then.
every time i ever see you, that is what i see.
uh, talk to you later.  bye.
you all right?
yeah.
why are you crying?
I am not crying.
maybe you should not drink so much.
I am okay. i just -  you just have to understand. I have been with lester since i was a kid. i just wanted to say goodbye. i - i just...  i don't... i think i have a right to do that. okay?
it is all right. that part of your life is over with. right?
yeah.
you are with me now.
yeah.
right?
uh-huh.
you sure?
yeah. yeah.
want to go? let's go back in.
okay.
you are kidding? my god. what is it?
it is chinchilla.
oh, it is so soft.
it is nice is not it?
oh...
so, do you think it is too much if i wear these in the same day?
you do whatever you want. do i keep my promises, or do i keep my promises?
you are so wonderful. the jewelry's not so bad, either.
the only thing is... you should not keep this in the house. we got to put it in a bank.
come on. can i keep this one in the house?
now look,  pay attention to me. what I am going to tell you is very important.
okay.
all this stuff does not mean anything. money, this, does not mean anything without trust. i have to be able to trust you with my life.
crooked cops and kidnappers, they do not take checks.
need a little help with that, mr collins?
so, i put two million in cash in a los angeles bank under the name of mr and mrs tom collins. this was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
now this is just a signature card.
so, once she signs those papers, she will be the only person to have total access to the box?  no one else, including myself?
that is right.
sam, let me ask you a question. you must really trust your wife.
yeah, sure i do. why?
no, tha-that's good. it is just unusual. to tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
well...
...nicky was dreamin' his own kind of vegas.
to begin, i put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. you know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
...the next thing i did, i started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
it was so obvious. i mean, all of nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
and i did not want any of those agents near my place.
four aces, doc.
i mean, nicky's a made guy and I am not. i can not do that.
be careful. gaming agents are all over the place.
so, I am lucky. I am not allowed to get lucky in this place?
you been lucky all week. they are lookin' to nail ya.
fuckin' asshole will not budge.
call security.
sir, you are going to have to leave. you mind accompanying us outside?
bullshit, i am not goin' anywhere with you!
bullshit, you are out of here, cowboy!
fuck you! fuck you!
yeah?
you know who you are fuckin' with?! huh? do you?!
now move along.
you fuckin' faggot! do you know who you are fuckin' with?
leave me alone!
here we go!
you have got to be kidding me!
no, i did not know that. but you know what he did?
no.
he insulted billy. and then i walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
what?
then he called me a faggot.
so what do you think i do? i threw that cocksucker out.
what? ho-  hey, come here.
you called my friend a faggot? you tell him to go fuck himself?
nicky, i did -
is that what you did?
i did - i did not -
tell him to go fuck himself? you fuckin' hick!  fuckin'...
...you big fuckin' hick, you. come here. come here. get him up. come here.
get up.
come here, come here.
get up.
you go over there right now and you apologize. you better hope he lets you back in.
if he does it again, he is out for good. i do not care what it is, nick, I am going to ha- I will - I will never let him in the place again.
I am sorry about this. really.
all right, ace?
okay.
thanks, pal.
you took your boots off? you put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  you fuck me up over there, I will stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! you understand?  go over there and apologize.  go! get the fuck out of -
nicky, I am sorry.
but I will tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. he knew all the fuckin' angles. he brought over the whole 'femme fatale' show from paris. but he forgot how lazy them european dancin' broads can get. i mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they did not blow up like fuckin' balloons.
you are still eight pounds over.  what is the reason for this?
mr rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
never mind the 'sir'. never mind the 'sir'.
well, sir, i was just...
why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
i...
...position...
'mr rothstein' is good enough.
mr rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
she could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  listen...
...and she does not always -
...all you do is give me answers. just - just give me the right answer.
but, sir. well, i do not know why. i guess, maybe, because she is frightened that if she does not lose the weight she may even get fired.
that is right. she will get fired. in fact, i want you to send her back to paris.
it is always been our policy -
no. just stop everything.
this woman's an institution.
i do not care what she is. she is an institution, that is the problem. she is lazy.
hey, i got to give the guy credit. he does the most obvious thing. this is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  so... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off him.
between...
you better watch yourself. there is a lot of heat on you already.
why, somebody is complaining?
I am - I am hearin' things from security. they are all ex-cops. the sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. they want to put you in the black book.
that black book is a bunch of bullshit. they got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still al capone.
bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you are going to be in a lot of trouble. you will not be able to walk into the casino. I am tellin' you.
what am i doin' out here? I am tryin' to make a livin', that is all.
I am just tellin' you. do not say i did not warn you.
all right.
hi. nice to see you.
she could be the most charming woman you ever saw. people loved to be around her.
hey, do you want to see this one? daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  put your arm in there.
but as much as they loved her...
oh, fabulous.
...they did not know what really moved her.
loose machines are right back over there.
what are they doin' way back there? bring 'em up here where they belong. you can not even see 'em over there.
okay, I will -
what about the progressives with the high jackpots? where are they? these machines are hidden.
well...
these are our best machines. they bring all the action. no wonder the drop is off.
yeah, okay.
the action is in the front, not in the back. bring 'em up front.
all right, i will, i will.
listen to me very carefully. there are three ways of doing things around here. the right way, the wrong way, and the way i do it. you understand?
i do understand that. I will get right on it. and thank you.
do not thank me, just do it. you are the slots manager. i should not have to tell you this.
dang, you are right, mr rothstein, i am so sorry.
so, what did you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
i told him i was mrs sam rothstein.
well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
well, it was not long before what i was afraid was going to happen, happened. nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in las vegas, and from then on, i could not be seen talkin' to him anywhere in vegas, or even near it.
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
' ...detrimental to gaming. and he will be ejected from any casino in las vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  do you believe this shit?
yeah, i believe it. you got banned.
motherfucker.  unsavory fuckin'... is there any way around this?
nope, there is no way.
let's say... for instance... i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches i like?
forget it. you can not even set foot in the parking lot. that is how serious it is.
in other words, I am fucked.
in so many words, yes.
it just did not sink into his head about the black book and what it meant. not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and fbi agent in the state. i mean, you are listed in there with al capone. but nicky did not care.
i got to do somethin'. i got to do somethin'. they am not gettin' rid of me. they are not gettin' rid of me. I am staying here. fuck 'em. fuck 'em.
sometimes i used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. but i did not like the people i was rippin' off lookin' at me, so i used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
what is takin' so long over there?
this peter's a motherfucker.
- back to  nigeria.  yeah.
listen...
...they're in penthouse k.
they check in alone?
they checked in alone.
are they out now?
yes, do not worry.
all right.
whenever we got local merch, we would usually send it to palm spring or arizona... la. i had a couple of sand niggers out there. you know, arabs.
what, are you going to have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you going to buy some diamonds?
i actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where i kept the choice stuff.
she asleep?
every night, on the couch.
give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
i took care of everybody.
yeah?
yeah, that works out.
but how much cash could i bury in my closet, right?
you need to understand, and i - I am sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
oh, listen, i understand that there is always a risk... you know, i might have to take a loss somewhere.
so i put some of the money into legitimate deals with charlie clark. he was ace's banker.
i mean, you will try to push it through, will not you, mr clark?
yes.
well, you got to understand, I am giving you fifty thousand cash.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
is that the last one?
i had my kid brother, dominick, run it for me.
fuckers!
yeah, nicky loved restaurants. he was a real restaurant buff. and over the years, he always made money with them.
hey, rich.
you walk past me?
hey. this is shelly.
hey, shelly.
and this is stacy.
stacy.
this is nick.
pleasure.
when i left here with the money...
mm.
...i got muscled on the street.
mm.
a couple of guys, i owe them. so, that is what i did. i gave 'em the money.  that is what i did.
yeah?
yeah.
you call yourself a man? you know you are a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? you know that is what you are? two small kids at home. i gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. you know your wife called frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
no, no? you didn't?
i did not give 'em the m-
do not fuck with me, al! do not make a fuck out of me! you want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  you did not gamble?! tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I will give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! did you gamble?! huh?!
fuckin' kids at home!  here.  get the fuck out of here.
thanks, nick.
yeah, thanks.
how many of these you gonna eat, huh?
two.
two?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, nicky- boy.
here, let's put a little of this on for you. i know you like this. a little butter, right, not a lot?
mm-hm.
you know why, right?
yeah.
why?
'cause it clogs up your heart.
what a smart kid you are!  okay, eat.
...remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
remo.
hey, frankie.
how are you?
fine, fine.
i mean, the cops knew, but they did not give a fuck. i mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
nicky sends his warmest regards.
uh-huh. good.
but i knew how to keep the bosses happy. whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, i would carry things out...
and how are things going down there?
fine. everything's goin' good.
...to a tee. like the time tony dogs...
...i want all the names of all the other people he had with him. and i do not care what you have to do to him to get 'em. you understand?
I will take care of it, remo.
e mo va! [italian-american slang for 'now, go!']
yeah, thanks a lot.
but he never talked.
listen to me, anthony. i got your head in a fuckin' vise. I am going to squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you do not give me a name. do not make me have to do this, please. come on. do not make me be a bad guy. come on.
fuck you!
this motherfucker, do you believe this? two fuckin' days and nights!  fuck me?
oh, god! give me the fuckin' name!
ch-charlie m!
charlie m?
charlie m.
charlie m? you make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? charlie m? you dumb motherfucker!
kill me, you fuck, kill me.
kill you,  you motherfucker you!  frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? do you have any idea what the odds are?
shoot, it is got to be in the millions, maybe more.
three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? why did not you pull the machines? why did not you call me?
well, it happened so quick. three guys won. i did not have a chance to call you.
you did not see the scam? you did not see what was goin' on?
well, there is no way to determine that, sam.
yes, there is. an infallible way! they won!
well, it is a casino. people got to win sometimes.
hey... ward, you are pissin' me off. now, you are insulting my intelligence. what do you think, I am a fuckin' idiot? you know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
the probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. on three machines in a row, it is in the billions.  it cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! what is the matter with you!  did not you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
i really think you are -
you - wait! you did not see that you were being set up on the second win?
i really think you are overreacting in this whole -
listen, you fuckin' yokel, I have had it with you. I have been carryin' your ass in this place ever since i got here. get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
you are firin' me?
I am firin' you? no, I am not firin'  I am firin' you, you -
you might regret this, mr rothstein.
I will regret it even more if i keep you on.
this is not the way to treat people.
listen, if you did not know you are bein' scammed, you are too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. if you did know, you were in on it. either way, you are out!  get out! go on.  let's go.
i mean, the guy is history as far as I am concerned. history.
but you can not just fire him. webb's his brother-in-law. he is county commissioner.
so what? everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I am fuckin' sick of it.
this is his state. his uncle's chief judge. his brother-in-law runs the county commission. i do not know how many other relatives he is got in town.  there is got to be a way to work him back in.
phil, i can understand. you are in the finances, you are upstairs, but you are not on the floor. i got thousands of players. i got five hundred dealers.  they are all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. i have to let them know I am watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing i will not catch as i am over here.
look at yours.
what?
look at that. look at this. there is nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. yours is falling apart. i have nothing.
what are you talking about?
it is like everything else in this place. you do not do it yourself, it never gets done.
okay, want to go with mommy?
what do you need?
you get her?  okay.  well, i need a lot. i need more than usual.
well, why do not you take it out of your account? there is a lot there.
well, i would, you know, sam. it is just that... well, i need more than that. i need twenty-five thousand.
twenty-five thousand? for yourself?
yeah.
why do you need that much?
well, what is the difference? i just need it.
well, i mean... you know, i got to ask you. that is a lot of money. you are not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. i mean...
I am aware of that. we do not have to turn this into a big deal.  okay? we do not have to have a fight. it was important to me. but forget it. just something i wanted to do for myself.
who is fighting? i mean, i'm, you know, tell me what it is for.
huh?  well, you know what? now, i want you to tell me. i mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. i mean, what do you want? do you want a coat?
no.
well, if you want a coat, you got it. you know that. it is not the money, it is just why do you want it?  that is all I am askin'. am i not entitled to that?
look - sam, I have been independent my whole life. i never had to ask anybody for anything. now you are making me beg you for this.
what are you talkin' a- ?
okay? and you are embarrassing me. why do want to make me feel so bad?
you are askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I am not out to make you feel bad. i want to just be able to trust you. you now, it is about trust. i have to be able to trust you with my life. do you understand? can i trust you?  can i trust you?... can i trust you?... answer me. can i trust you?
you can trust me.
good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
what does that mean? no, i know that look. what does that mean?
it means i got the money.
you got money. that is a - that is a good look.
she is my wife.  look at me. you did know that, did not you? you knew that she is my wife? huh? hey, look at me.
yeah, yeah. i know that.
you do? yeah? well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. that way you got a chance. be a man, do not be a fuckin' pimp. now, you want to do me a favor? get out of here. i want to be alone with my wife. get the fuck up and get out of here.
okay.
you fuckin' piece of shit.
hey, that is just fuckin' - that is bullshit. you know, you know, what the fuck?
you remember when you called him that night? when you said goodbye to him?  he did not say, 'don't get married, I will be right down, we will get married.'  he did not say that to you, did he?
no, he didn't.
didn't. no, instead, what did he say? 'fuck him. take him for everything he is got.'
tell me.
i know it was not a nice thing to do but -
yeah, no shit.
well, you got to understand it. he does not know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
no! no! i told him all about the guy before we ever got married. this is no fuckin' surprise.
oh, you did? i did not know that.
yeah. he is just a friend of mine i was trying to help, so... so what?
you know... the first time i ever saw your guys together... i never saw him so happy. i mean, i know he is a crazy jew fuck and everything, but...
i never see - you know, i never seen him act like that with anybody else. i think he is crazy about you. i mean, he really loves you. he does.
oh, come on. i went into this with my eyes open, you know. i knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I am a working girl, right?  you do not think I am going to go into a situation like this if i do not think I am going to get covered on the back end.
sure.
am i right?
i can see that. sure.
so, he put aside some jewelry for me. a lot of jewelry.
you mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? about how much?
mm, you want to steal it?
no. i - I am just curious, you know. i was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. that is all.
I am told it is worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
well, there you go. but what does that tell ya? a million dollars in jewelry. does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
i should have never married him. he is a gemini. a triple gemini... duality.  gemini's the snake. you know you can not trust the snake.  i mean it.
i know what you mean.
listen, ginger... you know, this is probably not... i do not have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you are a little upset with ace.
i do.
i understand that. but, you know, i think you should try to make the best of it now. go slow, you know. see what happens.
he could have killed him! okay? he could have killed him.
he did not have to hit him. it is not exactly like I am sleepin' with the guy! and he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! what the fuck is that all about?
well, i guess it is 'cause he loves you so much. he is jealous and worried.
he gives a fuck what i do?
look, I will try to find out what the hell's goin' on. when i see him I will talk to him.
okay.
all right?
yeah.  thanks.
and take it easy with this shit, will you? i mean, this can only make matters worse.
oh, come on.
you are a beautiful girl. you do not want to ruin your looks. I have seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
you are so nice.
come on, now, i do not want to see you unhappy.
thanks.
yeah.
thank you.
it is all right.
mr rothstein...  I am pat webb.
how do you do?
hey, it is my pleasure.
yeah, i heard a lot about you.
oh, thank you, sir.
hey, house is doin' well.  hey, all that money is rollin' in. i appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor old civil servant.
no, that is quite all right.
uh, i come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. see, uh, maybe you did not know it, but, uh, don ward is a very well-liked man in this town. he is got lots of friends here. now, his family and their money go back many, many years. now, friends vote... family and money votes. that is important to me... and you. and if you will think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
I am sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. that means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. either way, i cannot have a man like that workin' here.
before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
believe me, if i could prove it, he would be under arrest.
are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like nicky santoro?
i think you are way out of line talkin' to me like that. what you are sayin' is libelous, and you are in no position to challenge my expertise. i went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. he is weak, he is incompetent. he jeopardizes the whole place. there is not much more i can do for him.
you have got me there. old don is as useless as tits on a boar.  but, he is my brother-in-law, and i would look on it as a personal favor if you would think some more on hirin' him back.
i can not do that. and i appreciate the fact that he is your brother-in- law, and i do want to help you and i like to do favors, and i know who you are, but i cannot do that.
well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
I am sorry, i can not do anything. he is too incompetent. and the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
okay, thanks.  um... you know, that is it. I am sorry.
mr rothstein. your people never will understand the way it works out here. you are all just our guests. but you act like you are at home. let me tell you somethin', partner... you am not home. but that is where we are going to send you if it harelips the governor.  thank you for your time.
no problem.  sorry.
you bet.
huh?
is not it bad enough you are drinkin' too much, you are takin' all my pills too?
i did not take your pills.
look - for my ulcer, i take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. and that is when i have extreme pain. i had a three-month supply. what did you do with 'em?
you did not have to beat him up!
what?
i was just tryin' to help him. it is not like I am sleeping with the guy!
yeah, how do i know?
you can not make me stop caring...
what? what?!
i said, you can not make me stop caring about people.
listen.  ginger. I am tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  i mean, you are my wife, for chrissakes. uh, i mean... people look up to you in this town. i do not know what to think -
you know what, ace? i do not give a shit! I am gettin' out of here.  i am.
it is okay.  look...  ...you got to get a hold of yourself.
okay.
if not for me, at least for amy.
okay, okay.
you understand? your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I am going to get you into a program. they got plenty of good ones.
i do not need one.
yes, you do. it is very discreet. there is no names in the papers. you do not have to worry about any of that stuff.
that is all you care about.  you do not care about me at all.
yes, i - yes, i do.
no, you don't.
how could you say that?  you are a beautiful woman. you are destroying yourself. you do not need that stuff. you do not need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. i know you better than you know yourself. you are a tiger, you are stronger than i am. and when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  you can do it.  you can do it.
oh, god. oh, god. okay.  okay... I will try. I will try.
i was out there with my cumma [italian- american slang for 'girlfriend'.]
your cumma? what are you doin' with your cumma?
what else? i gave her a schaff [italian-american slang for 'tap'.]
you gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
come on, go back there? i never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
what expenses?
well, I am goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and i never get anything back. what the hell's goin' on?
you gotta go back out there.
well, then, from now on, I am going to start keepin' records.
artie, no records, artie. what are you gonna do with records? pay taxes?
well, i keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. i mean, what hell's goin' on? what are we doin' over here?
you are goin' out to las vegas, you are havin' a good time at my expense. what the fuck? i mean, after all, you are the one having a good time, not me.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
i can not believe you are doing this.
it turned out phil green, mr integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the tangiers...
why are you doing this to me?
I am a little in shock, quite frankly...
now, instead of the cops only lookin' at nicky, they started looking at green too. and he was supposed to be our squeaky...
hello.
listen...
no, no it is okay.
it is impossible. it is booked up, and you got to make a reservation.  it's...
...very difficult to get in.
well, it is okay. I will use the service entrance. I will see you at nine.
hey, ace.
hey.
want something to drink? charlie you want a refill?
yeah, refill'd be great.
no, i do not want one.  hey, mr clark, how you doin'?
hi. good.
I have been trying to reach you. you are tougher to get than the president.
well, I have been busy.
yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
listen... nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, i explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
yeah.  i think i want my money back.
what are you going to do? strong-arm me?
you know... i think that you have gotten the wrong impression about me. i think in all fairness, i should explain to you what it is that i do. for instance, tomorrow morning I will get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you do not have my money for me, I will crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. and just about the time that I am comin' out of jail, hopefully, you will be comin' out of your coma. and guess what?  I will split your fuckin' head open again. because I am fuckin' stupid. i do not give a fuck about jail.  that is my business. that is what i do. and we know what you do, do not we, charlie? you fuck people out of money and get away with it.
you can not talk to me like...
hey, you fat irish prick. you put my fuckin' money to sleep. you go get my money, or I will put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
sam?
never mind fuckin' sam. this is personal.  I will be there in the morning. you can fuckin' try me, fatso.
you think he got the point?
what are you doin'? he is a square guy, for chrissakes.  you can not treat him like that. he is going to run to the fbi.
fuck the fbi! that prick's been dodging me for three weeks. and what is it with you?  all of a sudden, you are tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
I am not tryin' to tell you what to do. but you were way out of line, nick. what are you doin'? where is your head?
where is my head? where is your fuckin' balls? huh? you know I am tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. you know what I am talkin' about, huh? you know!  if you are actin' like this now, how can i depend on you?  there is a lot of things going to change out here. and if you wanna be there with me, sammy, you are going to have to go my fuckin' way.
listen, nick, you got to understand my situation. I am responsible for thousands of people. i got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  it is all over, I am going to tell you, it is all over, if i do not get that license.  and believe me, if it goes bad for me, it is going to go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. i plant my own flag out here, you am not going to need a fuckin' license.  you know, i do not know what it is, sammy, but the more i talk to you, the more i feel like you just do not wanna go along with me, is that it?
no, i do not wanna come -
you should say so.
i do not wanna come along with you.
just say so.
I will be honest with you.
all right, fine.
i do not wanna be involved in anything you are talkin' about...
fine.
...okay? i just wanna run a square joint. that is it. i just want my license. i want everything nice and quiet. that is it.
you mean, quiet like this: 'i'm the boss.'  that is quiet?
that is all taken out of context. okay.
yeah, that is out of context. okay.
i have no control over that. ronnie and billy were right there. they will tell you exactly what happened.
well, back home they do not know about fuckin' control. that looks bad.
looks bad? I am going to tell you what looks bad.
yeah?
every time you are on television i get mentioned. that looks bad. that looks bad.
what the fuck happened to you? will you tell me?
what happened to me? what happened to you?
yeah.
you lost your control.
i lost control?
yes, you lost your control.
look at you. you are fuckin' walkin' around like john barrymore.
all right.
a fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
all right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I am - i lost control?!
yeah.
you know, i did not want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. even your own wife.
my wife?
yeah.
now, what does she have to do with all this?
well, she comes to see me. she was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' diamond - that lester diamond incident.
all of a sudden, you are the shoulder to cry on? did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
no, i didn't. what good would that do? that is not the fuckin' point.
listen, i would -
the point is that she is upset. she is - and you got a fuckin' problem.
i - i would appreciate it if you would stay out of my personal life, okay? you would not like it if i did it to you.
hey, she came to talk...
please...
...to me.
...don't do it to me...
she came to talk to me...
okay?
and i - what was i supposed to do, throw her out?
ju-just stay away from her. it is none of your business, okay? there are certain things you do not do, and you know that.
it is none of my business?
that is right, yeah.
a week ago it was my business, now it is none of my business. in other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
yeah, that is right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I am going to have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
this guy is gonna run to the fbi.
your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. that is your problem, pal.
i knew what he wanted, and i did not want any part of it.
fuckin' walking around with a big head. you better check yourself...
nicky wanted to take over. he wanted to go after gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. there were never any witnesses.
the coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and i mean every little fuckin' thing too.
frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. do you know about that?
yeah, i heard, yeah.
yeah. everybody's talkin' about it. they are makin' a big deal out of it.
i know.
it is in all the papers.
what are you going to do?
and i mean... that is no good.
i know.
you gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I will tell him, remo.
...bosses. i mean, they are smokin' their di nobilis and they are eatin' a trippa [italian-american slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? while, if i wanna talk private, i got to go to a fuckin' bus stop.
but, hey, what do they care, as long as i keep sendin' money back.
yeah, but they are complaining.
let 'em complain. I am the one who is here.
i do all the work. somebody do not like it, fuck him.
it is up to you.
they want a fuckin' war, I am ready.
peekaboo, you fucks, you.
i see you, you motherfuckers.
the problem was, nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. the fbi watched every move he made. but he did not care. he just did not care.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. he has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he is out playin' golf.
practice enough this week, you prick?
and at the...
...worst possible time for me.
a record of the arrests...
i had my license hearing coming up and i did not wanna leave anything to chance.
that was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
i mean, if i can not work in vegas, where am i going to go?
you have been very open with us. i mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that is going to mean something when you go before the commission.
well, that is all i ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
hey! oh!
oh, sorry -
what is the matter with you?
receipts and bills and... everything's here.
since when do you talk like that?
I am sorry.
there is a lot of people here.
nance gives me trouble and I will tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I will take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
again!
i did not curse. i said 'frickin' head'.
that is enough.
I am sorry.
I have never trusted him. and you know i got eyes...
...behind my head. they trust that scumbag, i don't. right now, the way i feel, I will hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
all right, take it easy now, take it easy.
mom, I am sorry, they are beatin' me left and right.  ma, I am sorry. I am all upset.
i know, but that is enough.
you know - you know - you know what they are doin' to me?
i know it, i know it.
i can not take this no more. back and forth, back and forth.
take it easy, though.
all right, all right. but i - i -
you will get a heart attack like that.
you know, i - I am too upset right now. and - an end has to be put to this.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. i got to pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
you are right. what can i...
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
then do it the way you want.
pardon me, counselor. before you continue...
no, i want to have this marked, mr. -
...this, uh, this commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the rothstein application.
denying?
do i hear a motion seconded?
mr. chairman -
i was never - i was never your guest at the tangiers.
you were never my guest?!
that is right.
i never comped you?! i do not comp you at least two or three times a month at the tangiers?!
uh, i - i'd... I would like to answer - answer that at this time.
liar.
mr rothstein is being very typical to this point.
he is lying.
the only time i was at the tangiers was when i had dinner with barney greenstein.
was i at that dinner? just tell me -
you were wandering around.
was i at that dinner?
you were wandering around.
was i at that dinner?
you were wandering around.
was i at that dinner?
you were in the m- you were in the building.
i was in the building!
you know damn well i was at that dinner, and you swore to me that i would have a fair hearing at that dinner! did you not?! did you not?!  well, tell me i was at least at the dinner! a-allow me that much.  give me that much at least!
yes, you were.
yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. you son-of-a-bitch. you son-of- a
good evening, everyone, I am paige novodor.  what should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant tangiers casino executive, sam
...'ace' rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
what are you running for, bob? what are you running for?
...and hypocrisy.
do not you remember? you promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
in a  wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, rothstein followed several...
bullshit! bullshit!
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
we all have a past. you have a past, i have a past. and my past is no worse than yours. but you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
long suspected of running the tangiers without...
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
...well, I have got a large family.
how many kids do you have?
uh, I am very proud to say that we have eight children.
eight children!
no, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
that is amazing.
there was nothing to it.  it was my pleasure.
he is on all night, screamin' about how he is going to take his damn lawsuit all the way to the supreme court. he really must be crazy. he is going to go to washington with this?  he is out of his fuckin' mind.
it is a pity in this...
first of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. we are already on the list to be heard before the supreme court of the united states later this year.
these guys back home do not give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit! they want things to quiet down. they want you to walk away from -
walk away? andy, you can not be serious. how can i walk away? do not you see what is goin' on here? do not you see what is at stake?
the old man said, 'maybe your friend should give in.'  and when the old man says 'maybe', that is like a papal bull. not only should you quit, you should run!
know what my problem is? every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention nicky, too. how the fuck does that help?  i mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  we had a police department who was cooperative. he is pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. i mean, what do you do about that?
what do you propose?
i do not know, he does not listen to me. maybe he should...  get lost for a while. take a vacation. would that be so bad?
they am not sendin' nicky nowhere.
all right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. that is all I am saying. it is all that I am saying.
i would forget about the maneuver. i would just get out.
i can not do that.
you know, i do not feel like playin' tennis.
...as soon as andy got back home, nicky heard about our talk in the car.
let's go to lunch. do you want to go to the riviera?
next morning bright and early, i get the call.
great.
you know, I have got to do some shopping afterwards. do you want to go?
well, you know...
you see, if a phone's tapped, the feds can only listen in...
...on the stuff involving crimes. so on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
yeah, and i get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
yeah.
meet me at three.
what - what, caesar's?
no, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.
why?
do not ask questions. just be there.
...same outfit.
but i saw something...
where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? goin' over my head?
what people?
what people! what did you think, i was not going to find out?
i do not even know what you are talkin' about, nick.
no? you said I am bringin' heat on you?! i got to listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! you are ordering me out?! you better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
i did not do anything. i mean, i did not order you or anybody...  i only told andy stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
you want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
yeah, i said i - let the bullshit blow over for a while so i can run the casino. anything goes wrong with the casino, it is my ass. it is not yours, it is my ass.
oh, i do not know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because i made that possible!
i -
I am what counts out here! not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' tv shows! and what the fuck are you doin' on tv anyhow?!
what are you -
you know i get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  they think you went batshit!
I am only on tv because i got to be able to hang around the casino. you understand that. you know that. come on.
your fuckin' ass! you could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  you wanted to go on tv.
yeah, i did want to go on tv. that way i have a forum. i can fight back. I am known. people see me. they know they can not fuck around with me like they could if i was an unknown. that is right.
you are makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
me?! i would not even be in this situation if it was not for you. you brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. i mean, every time i meet somebody here, the big question is do i know you.
oh, sure. now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
no, it - it - nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did i tell you? i mean, you asked me, and i knew you were going to come out no matter what i said, but what did i tell you? do you remember what i told...
back -
...you? do you remember what i told you?
back - back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. one minute. i asked you?! when the fuck did i ever ask you if i could come out here?! get this through your head, you -
you never - ?
get this through your head, you jew motherfucker, you. you only exist out here because of me!  that is the only reason!  without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' jew ass! then where you going to go?!  you are fuckin' warned! do not ever go over my fuckin' head again! you motherfucker, you!
do you see that? dumb jew motherfucker. grew up together and he is actin' like he do not even know me. i know we are supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there is ways to do things and there is ways not to.
yeah. fuck him.
to abraham lincoln.
l'chaim. [yiddish for 'to life']
here we go. good luck.
forget about it, nick. do not let it bother you.
why, does it look like it is bothering me? what do i give a fuck?  fuckin' oscar too. all the fuckin' money I have given that prick, he do not even look over here. what is his problem?
mm.
fuckin' jews stick together, do not they?
they are havin' a good time too.
so are we.
sam, we got a problem.
what is it?
the little guy. he is half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
now, he is really pissed.
oh, no.
he wants a fifty-thousand marker.
no, just - just give him, give him ten. that is it. ten.  I will be right down.
he is going to come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
he is here.
you should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
what are you doin'? you got to get out of here!
hey, sammy, tell this jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
nicky, nicky, you are not listenin' to me. I am here to help you. what is the matter with you?  you are going to bury us both.
just give me the money. fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, sammy.
I am going to okay you ten and get you even, and that is it. then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
sue me, you jew fuck!
let's get out of here.
what? get out of here? i got a marker comin'.
i mean she is only sober about two hours a day. it is usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. and if i gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she is going to do? she is going to piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  where would you be then? comin' right back to me, right back to me.  or finding some other excuse to come and i - i -
we had a deal. remember that?  he said if it did not work out between us, that i could get my things and i could leave.
look in my eyes. look in my eyes.

lester - he called you here.
right.
here.
he was just on the phone.
he called you right here.
i just talked to him.
so, he knows where you are. that means he is sending some guys over here probably right now.
ginger... it means he is sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. now, i -
that is - yeah, he is sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. that is what he is -
he is sittin' by the phone -
what do you think we are going to do? he is probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
get your bag! come on, get your bag! get your things! let's go!
it is this bullshit. it is just bullshit right here. this is the fuckin' problem, you know.
oh, what bullshit? what, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
you are done yakkin', okay? you are done yakkin' now?
go! go! get in the car! go!
'go! go! go!'
you just relax. nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
no, i really do. i think he is going to kill me.
you just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I will see what i can do.
yeah, uh-huh... okay.
so, I am going to call you back in an hour... at this number, and you are going to be there, right?
I will be there.
and listen, do not do anything else crazy, okay? you all right? okay.
bye.
just knock it off! would you two knock it off? get in the car.
she started it. she started the whole thing. I am just standin' here.
you are not going to drive. do not even think you are going to drive.
no, I am going to drive.
no, I am not going to drive with some crazy -
you are driving me nuts!
ginger called me.
yeah.
i just told you. she called me.
and what did she want?
she was afraid to call you.
yeah, she is with that cocksucker again... and they got amy.
well, that is why I am here. she wants to come back, but she is afraid you are going to whack her out.
yeah, they are going to kidnap my kid. what do you want?
i know. why did not you come to me? i mean, this is family, it am not business. meanwhile, you make calls back home. sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what i mean? back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she is gone anyway. am i right?
i do not know. what am i going to do with this woman? i do not know...  she is drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
i think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she is going to be all right, she will come back.
she is driving me fuckin' crazy.
well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  but get the kid back here. she wants to come back. that is the, uh, that is the main thing here. you want your kid, do not you? huh?
hello.
hi, it is me.  just who you wanted to talk to, right?
listen...
...uh-uh-uh - I am not going to ask you where you are, just please, put amy on a plane. just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...please. that is all I am askin' you.
do you... i mean... i do not think she should go by herself.
what do you mean?
what i mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if i came back... do you think you could forgive me?
uh,  i do not know. i got to tell you, i do not know.
right.
i under-understand that. i-i know i fucked up.
what about the money? uh, where is the box?
i gotta tell ya...
...i-i... made some mistakes and i spent some money.
what is it...
...under?
pretty serious.
how serious?
it's, uh, it is under twenty-five.
it is under...
...twenty-five thousand?
yeah.
and...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
yeah, yeah, i got the rest.
okay, no big deal. that is okay. yeah. he got his twenty-five.  that I will live with. any more i couldn't.
okay?
all right...
so, what did ya do with it?
with what?
with the money.
he needed some clothes.
twenty-five thousand for clothes.
he wanted a watch, too.
twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
mm-hm.
mm-hm.
the good part was, i had amy back. so, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, i calmed myself down and we went to dinner. i tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  but... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? that does not make much sense.
first of all, he is not going to wear f- thousand-dollar suits. but let's say he did, which he won't. how you going to get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  i, um, i mean, how could you get fitted that fast? i can not get fitted that fast, and i pay twice as much.
i bought him a watch too.
yeah.
yeah.
but even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he does not know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
yeah.
at the most, which is impossible for him.
plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. that still leaves what?  around ten thousand?
would you knock it off, sam?
I am just tryin' to figure it out.
there is nothin' to figure out. I am home... we are workin' it out.
yes, i want to kill you! i hate your fuckin' guts!
you hate my guts? i want you to come with me now.
get off of me! stop it!
come with me now! come with me now. come with me now. i want you out of here.
i want you out of here! i want you out of here!
let go of me! let go of me!
take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
I will go, but i want my money right now!
the arrangement is over!
no kidding. no kidding!
and i still get my money. i need some cash right now. you can not just put me in the street.
I will get your cash. you have not been straight with me ever since i met you! you never loved me in the first place!  i need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
you are lower than a dog!
fuck you!
here. here. is this enough money?! huh?  will it last you two fuckin' days? take it, greedy bitch.  take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am going to the bank and I am getting my jewelry too!
yeah, no kidding. good! it opens at 9 a.m. be there!
and do not send your guys down there to stop me! i mean it.
stop! you are not getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
you will come back tomorrow and get the rest. just get out of here.
fine.  I am takin' amy.
you are not takin' amy.
i am. I am wakin' her up right now.
you are stoned. you are a junkie. get out of here.
i am not! she is my daughter too! goddamn you!
get out of here!
oh. have a good day at school.
okay.
i mean, listen, two people do not get along, at some point you got to call it... i mean, it is none of my business, but i ... i think that is what you got to do. you got to take it somewhere -
oh, you are right, i know.  it's... well, i was just -
what? what?
nothin'.
what were you gonna say? go ahead.
i do not -
tell me what you were gonna say. go ahead.
yeah?
yeah.
well, i was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  there is a lot of money in there. lot of money in there, and I would be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
let me think about that.
okay.
see who i got in there. gotta get somebody i can trust.
mm-hm.
you know?
yeah. 'cause, you know,  he is never going to give me my jewelry.
hm.
he holds that key so tight, he is probably got it stuck up his ass.
yeah, right. that is sammy. and he is probably got it there too.
he is so fuckin' lucky. i could have buried him. i could have gone to europe and taken the baby. and then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
no, he wouldn't. i would have.  and he'd've been right, too. i mean, seriously.  well, there is one thing you do not do. you do not take a guy's kid and then take off.
i didn't.  i didn't. i mean, i did, but then i did exactly what you told me to do, and i came right back.
you did. you are right.
exactly.
you did. i like that. i like that. that is what i like about you. you did the right thing.
i did what you told me to.
yes, you did.
'cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
yeah.  boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - did not he?
sure did.
everything went to his head.
no, he is not.
he really thinks who the fuck he is, I will tell you that.
exactly.  he hates me.
he hates my fuckin' guts.
come on, come on, you are a toughie. you can take this.  do not cry.
I am not as tough as you think i am.
yes, you are.
I am not and he scares the shit out of me. i never know what he is going to do.
come on. do not be scared.
i need some help. i do. i need some help.  you gotta help me. i need a new sponsor, nicky.
i do. i need a new sponsor.
is that what you want?
yeah.
a sponsor.
yeah.
mm... okay. do not worry about it. nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I will take care of ya.
nicky, please...
yes, i will. it is what you want, is not it? huh?
thank you. yeah, yeah, yeah.
it is what you want?
yeah. uh-huh -
hi. you did not answer your beeper.
i threw it away.
you threw it away?
look, i tried to do this thing. i know that you want me to, but it is just - you know, I am driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. you know, I am in a restaurant and it is - it is embarrassing. i do not want to do it anymore.  where is amy?
i put her to bed.
oh.  i got your cigarettes.
oscar wants you to call him.
so, who would you go to lunch with?
with jennifer.
and where did you go?
to the riviera.
what did you have?
i had a... salad.
what did jennifer have?
she had the same.
okay. i want you to call jennifer and i want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I am going to listen in on the other line.
why do you want to do that?
you know why i want to do it. just do it.
fine.  just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
mm.
hello.
hello, jennifer, it is sam -
all right... i did not have lunch with jennifer.
who were you with?
i was with somebody.
i know you were with somebody. who was it?  i just hope it is not someone who i think it might be.  i just hope it is not them.
...she did what she did and i did what i had to do. but, jesus, nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
what if he will not stop?
i mean, it could get us both killed.
i can back him off.
frankie, i want to ask you something.
it is private... but i want you to tell me the truth.
of course, remo.
i want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
i always tell you the truth, remo.
frankie... the little guy, he would not be fuckin' the jew's wife, would he? because if he is... it is a problem.
what could i say? i knew if i gave the wrong answer, i mean, nicky, ginger, ace, all of 'em could have would up gettin' killed.
because there is one thing about these old timers: they do not like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. it is bad for business.
so, i lied... even though i knew that by lyin' to gaggi, i could wind up gettin' killed too.
no. i am not see anything like that.
are you sure?
I am positive.  remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
yeah, i know. that is why I am asking. you see, my main concern is nicky.
hm.
i want to know... if he is doin' all right. if he is okay.
he is good. he is fine.
I am askin' you, frankie, to keep an eye on nicky. do it for me.
no problem.
you see... i would not want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. you understand?
i understand.
okay.  frankie, you are a good boy.
you must have drunk too much.
go fuck yourself.
...stupid things.
watch it, partner, watch it!
the worst was blue.
...been right, but who knows?
jesus christ! what gun? he is got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
what do you want? it - it is pitch- black out here. it is tin foil.
pitch-black?! it -
it looked like a fuckin' gun!
you - you fuckin' moron, I will be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
oh my god, what are we going to do? I am sorry.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
walk, walk, walk. what did you say?
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
yeah, what did you tell him?
i told him i did not know nothin'. but jiggs and, uh, tony gorilla said if you did anything, you are fucked up.
you think he is goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
nah. you would have heard somethin'.
yeah, what is to stop him?
i know. i know.
i do not trust him anymore. but they would never okay anything, you know?
yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
well, now, sure they are askin'. they earn with the prick. i got a funny feelin' he is going to start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I am not sure yet, you know. but i w- you know, but you know what i want you to do?
what?
who is this guy? who is this guy?
oh, he am not nobody.
you know what i want you to do? get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it is at.
angelo and buster.
yeah, but I am not sure yet.
they will do it.
and when I am ready, I will say the words, 'go see the jew.'
yeah.
and you make it disappear, you know what i mean?
yeah, just let me know. but you got to be ready. you know what I am talkin' about?
did i say to do anything yet? i said I am not sure... I will let you know. i want to think about it. where are these pricks at?
do not know.
dominick said they are in the motel?
