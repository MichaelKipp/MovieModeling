...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. i don't know all the details.
matter of fact...
but it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. except you gotta do it right. i mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. and who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. you could be there all fuckin' night.
i hired an old casino pal, billy sherbert, as my manager and i went to work.
...and this is ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
for guys like me, las vegas washes away your sins. it's a morality car wash. it does for us what lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. and, along with making us legit...
you got a round figure on it?
definitely the most important guy in this room.
as far as the world was concerned andy stone, the head of the teamsters' pension fund, was a legitimate guy.
this is a very auspicious occasion.
a powerful man.
philip, if you would rise.
he even played golf with the president.
on behalf of the teamsters' pension fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
but andy also took orders. and when he was told to give a pension fund loan to philip green...
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new tangiers.
thank you.
...he did what he was told.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
you know, i don't know if i could do this even if i wanted to. the gaming commission would never give me a license. i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
you don't have to have a license to work in a casino. all you gotta do is apply for one. the state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. they got a ten-year backlog.
but what happens when they do find out?
why would they want to find out? we're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. why would they want to lock us out?  and besides, they'll never find out. all you gotta do is keep changing your job title. like, uh, from casino executive to food and beverage chairman. and what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. i know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
it's a tough proposition, andy. you, you know, if i did it, i'd have to run it my way.
you got it.
i'm serious. no interference.
nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. i guarantee it.
you know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
where the hell did you learn how to deal?
he bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
place the checks properly. that's the way you do it.
i'll take columbia for twenty.
if his girlfriend was knocked up.
but back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. to them, he was a cash register. all they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. especially remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
ma che cazzo!
i mean, unless ace made his bet.
that's enough now!
ace.
keepin' remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
son-of-a-bitch. how the hell did you get oklahoma-michigan?  nobody ever had oklahoma-mi... how the hell'd you do it?
well, that's why they paid so well.
you see?  never tells me nothin'. ace, what do we got on for next week?
well, it's a little too early. i'd say thursday would be good. i'll know by then. is that all right?
okay. you come by the house?
i'll come by.
seven o'clock?
seven o'clock.
hey, nick. vien acca. [italian- american slang for 'come here']
i'll be right out.
t'aggia parla. [italian-american slang for 'i've got to talk to you'] nicky... see that guy?
mm.
keep a good eye on him. he's makin' a lot of money for us. and he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
mm.
not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  okay?
all right.
uh-huh. mi raccomando. [italian- american slang for 'i'm counting on you']
yeah.
fine.
want me to take this for you?
yeah, we made a great pair. i made book and nicky made sure we always collected. the old men loved us. and why not? they all made money with us.
they payin'?
how did nicky collect?
it was eight.  ace... tell him the line on the bear's game.
eight.
if he don't know, nobody knows. told you it was eight.
well, how come i laid nine?
'cause you're a jag-off. i would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
excuse me.
what?
is this yours? your pen?
yeah, that's my pen. why?
i ju- well, it's a nice pen. i just didn't know whose it was. i thought it was yours. i didn't want it to get lost.
well, thank you. why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
what's that? you hear? you hear a little girl, frankie? you hear a little girl, ace? is that a little fuckin' girl?!  what happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! huh?! huh?!
wait a sec, nicky, nicky, nicky. ta- take it easy.
while i was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', nicky just hit him. no matter how big a guy might be, nicky would take him on. you beat nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. you beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. and you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
listen...
it won't happen again, sam.
mr rothstein.
we need this guy.
we can't get rid of him?
he's juiced in. he's the county commissioner's cousin.
i wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
hi, ace.
hello, senator.
hey, i need a room. need a room.
good to see ya.  william would you...
i had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
nice to see you, senator.
help the senator, give him whatever he wants.
certainly.  senator.
why not make them happy?
we have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. maybe the presidential suite.
yes!
thank you. very nice.
i told you i was hot tonight.
i'm sorry.
oh, i'm sorry. i'm sorry.  thank you very much. thank you very much.
thank you, sir, i appreciate that. everybody, thanks. gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. thanks. take care, steve. take chances and drive fast.
ginger, honey.
come on.
what's the matter?
what do you mean, 'what's the matter?' i made a lot of money for you. i want my cut.
what money? i've seen you stealing from me.
what money?  look at this stack of chips. don't give me that shit. i want my end.
ginger, i've been watching you all night. you've been stealing from me.
don't give me that shit. i want my money.
that bag's full of fuckin' chips you
what do you mean 'stole'? i didn't steal anything from you.
get lost, ginger! get lost!
get lost?
yes.
get lost?
yes.
well, how 'bout that?
come on!
i'm going to go powder my nose.
ginger's mission in life was money.
i'll be right back.
see you, ginger.
okay, thank you for asking.
she was a queen around the casino. she brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
hello.
any change?
i hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
that was all bullshit. she just pocketed the cash.
she took care of the dealers...
hey, mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
thank you.
but mostly...
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
thanks a lot.
but one thing i could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, lester diamond.
look, gin, you know i got other people in this. i got partners. but i want you to understand that i am lookin' out for you in this thing.  okay? you're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. okay?
all right.
okay?
yeah.
where are you goin'? where are you? you're in that place. where are you?
i'm here.
no, you're not. where are you? where are you?
i'm always here for you.
you are.
i am.
the ginger i knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
good luck.
yeah.
he was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. a scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
but nobody had to take care of nicky.
you find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
i mean, he took care of himself only too well. and that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
excuse me, but i folded these things beautifully and i would appreciate a little respect. jesus christ!
don't look at me, pal. i gotta live with her.
even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
excuse me.
i mean, frank marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. this time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in antwerp.
oh, yes. will you help me fold these, please?
they were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
you go and put your things away.
and they were usually right.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
hold it, hold it. here.
because nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
come on. there we go. look at that. beautiful.
i mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out nicky was about to be sent to vegas.
all right, we're clear.
there's more!
i think that's it.
there's more! there's a couple stuck in there. i know there's more.
god, i'm telling you, they're out!
come on, damn it. don't get so defensive. it could be stuck in your hair, you know.
look, there aren't...  there aren't but...
oh, there aren't?  what's that?  huh? what's that.  there's no more. thanks, hon.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
hey.
hey, how you doin'?
hey. hey, sammy, how are you?
wow.
boy, look at this place, huh?
incredible.
all right.
okay, sammy.
somethin', huh?
yeah.
ginger.
holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
honey, come here.
this is jennifer and nick. they're dear friends of mine.
good to meet you.
hi, jennifer.
pleasure.  very nice to meet you.
hi, how are you?
okay, sammy.
after we ate, we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. and then... he hit me with it.
what do you think about me movin' out here?  what's the matter? you got a problem with that?
no, of course not.
you mean, i have your permission?
sure, you have my permission. but i - i just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. it's no joke, you know? you gotta keep a low profile. it's not like back home. right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. and this sheriff's a real cowboy. even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
i don't care. i want to get away from back home for a while. i'm tired of that shit back there.  look at this place. it's made of money. you know what the best part is? nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! there's nobody here to see us! everybody's back home.
nick, i gotta tell you, i got pinched twice for no reason. you really gotta be careful. i'm running a licensed place. everything's legit.
don't worry about it. i'm not gonna do anything. what am i gonna do? i'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
ace saw vegas one way.
you call this guy and tell him i'm comin'?
of course.
but i saw it another. i saw it as untouched. i mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers i could shake down. who the fuck were they gonna run to?  so, i started getting everybody in line. best of all, for the first time in my life, i figured out a way not to lose.
yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. it wasn't very scientific but it worked. when he won, he collected. when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. what were they gonna do? muscle nicky?  nicky was the muscle.
tony.
hey.
how you doin'?
how you doin'?
all right, yeah. you got that thing for me?
what thing? oh, nicky... i thought you was layin'.
i was layin'? no, no, i'm taking it. i was takin' it.
you sure?
i'm positive.
well, i'm a little confused here.
you're a little confused?
yeah.
maybe if i stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. give me the fuckin' money!
i'm sorry, nicky. i didn't mean anything by it.
yeah, i know, that's why you had it ready. you thought i was fuckin' layin' it?!
my fuckin' head.
your fuckin' head, huh? don't fuck around, tony.
smarten up.
you jag-off.
beautiful. you got a beautiful swing.
ace got my son, little nicky, involved with little league, and it was great.
now, i want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'cause that's what's gonna win this game.
turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
...metro intelligence cop. but it didn't matter. i mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
you know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
yeah, well, that's exactly what i keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
it's instinctive, you know.
he tries to do everything...
ohh!
and, nicky being nicky, he made his presence known.
especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
me? that's why the bosses sent me out here. they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [eddy and jerry]. they were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  yeah, right, i'm sure.
hey, nicky, how are you? what are you doin' here?
i'm over here now.
yeah, i'm over here with him.
oh.
oh.
we're waiting on carmine.
yeah, we're lookin' for carmine.
carmine? he was here before. i saw him. he had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
carmine left?
uh-huh.
carmine left?
he's gone?
he's not here?
carmine's gone.
i think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. i don't know.
well, listen, uh... good luck with the joint, huh?
oh, thanks, eddy.
we had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
i'm just curious. i saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. can you do that with both hands?
no.
can't do it with both hands?
no, sir.
can you do it with your left hand?
well, i... i never tried.
so, you're a righty?
ye-yeah.
now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
god!
hiya. that's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
yeah.
why don't i take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
hi.
having a good time?
yes, uh...
you'll want to count the money in privacy. you know, you don't need...
uh, i have a plane to catch to cleveland...  can i get my winnings?
look what they did to my hand, man!
all right, i'm gonna give you a choice. you can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. you can't have both. what do you want?
i just wanna get out of here.
and don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. you understand?
i'm sorry. i made a bad mistake.
you're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. you see that fuckin' saw?  we're gonna use it. you don't fuck around in this place. you got it?
yeah.
get out of here.
thank you.
within no time, everything was set in place. we got rid of the freelance scamsters. the per was way up.  the gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  and i, i decided to complicate my life. for a guy who likes sure things, i was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
we're not getting any younger. don't you think it's time? aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? bangin' around, hustlin' around?
what, are you trying to handicap me?
i'm gonna do you one better. i'm trying to marry you. you want to marry me?  i'm serious. i mean, i - i want to settle down. i want a family.
you got the wrong girl, sam.
i know i'd be a good father. i know you'd be a good mother.
you don't know me. what, you've known me, two, three months. what do you know?
i'm forty-three years old. i don't want to wait. i know you well enough to know that i really love you very much.  and i can't think of anybody better to be with. and i don't feel like waiting anymore.
you know a lot of happily married people, sam? 'cause i don't.
yeah, i know all that.
i care about you, a - but i just don't have those kind of feelings for you. i'm sorry. i'm not in love with you.
i - i - i...
understand?  i'm sorry.
no, i - i... mean...  that can grow as i - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. i'm realistic. i can accept that. but, you know, what is... what is love anyway?  it's a... it's a mutual respect. it's - it's a devotion. it's a... it's a caring from one person to another. and if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  i feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that i could live with that.
if it doesn't work out. you know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
you know i'm doin' well now. and i'm gonna do even better. and so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, i'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. and if there are kids, especially, you know, i'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
what're you... what're you pitching me, here?
just what i said. you'll be set up for the rest of your life. that i can promise you.  want to take a chance?
when i married ginger i knew all the stories, but i didn't give a fuck. 'i'm sam rothstein,' i said. 'i can change her.'
it was typical ace. he invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  with ace, nobody ever got a free ride. even ginger. with her -
don't make me come there. answer me.
i love you.
bub-ut, baby, do you know that i love you too?
no, lester.
do you know that?
yeah. this is the best thing i can do for my life right now.
that's right.
so, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
promise?
god... i wish you...
...all the luck in the world.
you do?
yeah, i do. i mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. i mean this. and you'll have real security.  sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in vegas.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
okay, then.
every time i ever see you, that's what i see.
uh, talk to you later.  bye.
you all right?
yeah.
why're you crying?
i'm not crying.
maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
i'm okay. i just -  you just have to understand. i've been with lester since i was a kid. i just wanted to say goodbye. i - i just...  i don't... i think i have a right to do that. okay?
it's all right. that part of your life is over with. right?
yeah.
you're with me now.
yeah.
right?
uh-huh.
you sure?
yeah. yeah.
want to go? let's go back in.
okay.
you're kidding? my god. what is it?
it's chinchilla.
oh, it's so soft.
it's nice isn't it?
oh...
so, do you think it's too much if i wear these in the same day?
you do whatever you want. do i keep my promises, or do i keep my promises?
you're so wonderful. the jewelry's not so bad, either.
the only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. we gotta put it in a bank.
come on. can i keep this one in the house?
now look,  pay attention to me. what i'm gonna tell you is very important.
okay.
all this stuff doesn't mean anything. money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. i have to be able to trust you with my life.
crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
need a little help with that, mr collins?
so, i put two million in cash in a los angeles bank under the name of mr and mrs tom collins. this was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
now this is just a signature card.
so, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  no one else, including myself?
that's right.
sam, let me ask you a question. you must really trust your wife.
yeah, sure i do. why?
no, tha-that's good. it's just unusual. to tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
well...
...nicky was dreamin' his own kind of vegas.
to begin, i put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. you know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
...the next thing i did, i started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
it was so obvious. i mean, all of nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
and i didn't want any of those agents near my place.
four aces, doc.
i mean, nicky's a made guy and i'm not. i can't do that.
be careful. gaming agents are all over the place.
so, i'm lucky. i'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
you been lucky all week. they're lookin' to nail ya.
fuckin' asshole won't budge.
call security.
sir, you're gonna have to leave. you mind accompanying us outside?
bullshit, i ain't goin' anywhere with you!
bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
fuck you! fuck you!
yeah?
you know who you're fuckin' with?! huh? do you?!
now move along.
you fuckin' faggot! do you know who you're fuckin' with?
leave me alone!
here we go!
you've gotta be kidding me!
no, i didn't know that. but you know what he did?
no.
he insulted billy. and then i walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
what?
then he called me a faggot.
so what do you think i do? i threw that cocksucker out.
what? ho-  hey, come here.
you called my friend a faggot? you tell him to go fuck himself?
nicky, i did -
is that what you did?
i did - i didn't -
tell him to go fuck himself? you fuckin' hick!  fuckin'...
...you big fuckin' hick, you. come here. come here. get him up. come here.
get up.
come here, come here.
get up.
you go over there right now and you apologize. you better hope he lets you back in.
if he does it again, he's out for good. i don't care what it is, nick, i'm gonna ha- i'll - i'll never let him in the place again.
i'm sorry about this. really.
all right, ace?
okay.
thanks, pal.
you took your boots off? you put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  you fuck me up over there, i'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! you understand?  go over there and apologize.  go! get the fuck out of -
nicky, i'm sorry.
but i'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. he knew all the fuckin' angles. he brought over the whole 'femme fatale' show from paris. but he forgot how lazy them european dancin' broads can get. i mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
you're still eight pounds over.  what's the reason for this?
mr rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
never mind the 'sir'. never mind the 'sir'.
well, sir, i was just...
why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
i...
...position...
'mr rothstein' is good enough.
mr rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
she could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  listen...
...and she doesn't always -
...all you do is give me answers. just - just give me the right answer.
but, sir. well, i don't know why. i guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
that's right. she will get fired. in fact, i want you to send her back to paris.
it's always been our policy -
no. just stop everything.
this woman's an institution.
i don't care what she is. she's an institution, that's the problem. she's lazy.
hey, i gotta give the guy credit. he does the most obvious thing. this is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  so... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off him.
between...
you better watch yourself. there's a lot of heat on you already.
why, somebody's complaining?
i'm - i'm hearin' things from security. they're all ex-cops. the sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. they want to put you in the black book.
that black book is a bunch of bullshit. they got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still al capone.
bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. you will not be able to walk into the casino. i'm tellin' you.
what am i doin' out here? i'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
i'm just tellin' you. don't say i didn't warn you.
all right.
hi. nice to see you.
she could be the most charming woman you ever saw. people loved to be around her.
hey, do you want to see this one? daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  put your arm in there.
but as much as they loved her...
oh, fabulous.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
loose machines are right back over there.
what are they doin' way back there? bring 'em up here where they belong. you can't even see 'em over there.
okay, i'll -
what about the progressives with the high jackpots? where are they? these machines are hidden.
well...
these are our best machines. they bring all the action. no wonder the drop is off.
yeah, okay.
the action is in the front, not in the back. bring 'em up front.
all right, i will, i will.
listen to me very carefully. there are three ways of doing things around here. the right way, the wrong way, and the way i do it. you understand?
i do understand that. i'll get right on it. and thank you.
don't thank me, just do it. you're the slots manager. i shouldn't have to tell you this.
dang, you are right, mr rothstein, i am so sorry.
so, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
i told him i was mrs sam rothstein.
well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
well, it wasn't long before what i was afraid was gonna happen, happened. nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in las vegas, and from then on, i couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in vegas, or even near it.
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
' ...detrimental to gaming. and he will be ejected from any casino in las vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  do you believe this shit?
yeah, i believe it. you got banned.
motherfucker.  unsavory fuckin'... is there any way around this?
nope, there's no way.
let's say... for instance... i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches i like?
forget it. you can't even set foot in the parking lot. that's how serious it is.
in other words, i'm fucked.
in so many words, yes.
it just didn't sink into his head about the black book and what it meant. not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and fbi agent in the state. i mean, you're listed in there with al capone. but nicky didn't care.
i gotta do somethin'. i gotta do somethin'. they ain't gettin' rid of me. they're not gettin' rid of me. i'm staying here. fuck 'em. fuck 'em.
sometimes i used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. but i didn't like the people i was rippin' off lookin' at me, so i used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
what's takin' so long over there?
this peter's a motherfucker.
- back to  nigeria.  yeah.
listen...
...they're in penthouse k.
they check in alone?
they checked in alone.
are they out now?
yes, don't worry.
all right.
whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to palm spring or arizona... la. i had a couple of sand niggers out there. you know, arabs.
what, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
i actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where i kept the choice stuff.
she asleep?
every night, on the couch.
give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
i took care of everybody.
yeah?
yeah, that works out.
but how much cash could i bury in my closet, right?
you need to understand, and i - i'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
oh, listen, i understand that there's always a risk... you know, i might have to take a loss somewhere.
so i put some of the money into legitimate deals with charlie clark. he was ace's banker.
i mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, mr clark?
yes.
well, you gotta understand, i'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
is that the last one?
i had my kid brother, dominick, run it for me.
fuckers!
yeah, nicky loved restaurants. he was a real restaurant buff. and over the years, he always made money with them.
hey, rich.
you walk past me?
hey. this is shelly.
hey, shelly.
and this is stacy.
stacy.
this is nick.
pleasure.
when i left here with the money...
mm.
...i got muscled on the street.
mm.
a couple of guys, i owe them. so, that's what i did. i gave 'em the money.  that's what i did.
yeah?
yeah.
you call yourself a man? you know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? you know that's what you are? two small kids at home. i gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. you know your wife called frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
no, no? you didn't?
i didn't give 'em the m-
don't fuck with me, al! don't make a fuck out of me! you want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  you didn't gamble?! tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, i'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! did you gamble?! huh?!
fuckin' kids at home!  here.  get the fuck out of here.
thanks, nick.
yeah, thanks.
how many of these you gonna eat, huh?
two.
two?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, nicky- boy.
here, let's put a little of this on for you. i know you like this. a little butter, right, not a lot?
mm-hm.
you know why, right?
yeah.
why?
'cause it clogs up your heart.
what a smart kid you are!  okay, eat.
...remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
remo.
hey, frankie.
how are you?
fine, fine.
i mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. i mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
nicky sends his warmest regards.
uh-huh. good.
but i knew how to keep the bosses happy. whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, i would carry things out...
and how are things going down there?
fine. everything's goin' good.
...to a tee. like the time tony dogs...
...i want all the names of all the other people he had with him. and i don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. you understand?
i'll take care of it, remo.
e mo va! [italian-american slang for 'now, go!']
yeah, thanks a lot.
but he never talked.
listen to me, anthony. i got your head in a fuckin' vise. i'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. don't make me have to do this, please. come on. don't make me be a bad guy. come on.
fuck you!
this motherfucker, do you believe this? two fuckin' days and nights!  fuck me?
oh, god! give me the fuckin' name!
ch-charlie m!
charlie m?
charlie m.
charlie m? you make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? charlie m? you dumb motherfucker!
kill me, you fuck, kill me.
kill you,  you motherfucker you!  frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? do you have any idea what the odds are?
shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? why didn't you pull the machines? why didn't you call me?
well, it happened so quick. three guys won. i didn't have a chance to call you.
you didn't see the scam? you didn't see what was goin' on?
well, there's no way to determine that, sam.
yes, there is. an infallible way! they won!
well, it's a casino. people gotta win sometimes.
hey... ward, you're pissin' me off. now, you're insulting my intelligence. what do you think, i'm a fuckin' idiot? you know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
the probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. on three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  it cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! what's the matter with you!  didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
i really think you're -
you - wait! you didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
i really think you're overreacting in this whole -
listen, you fuckin' yokel, i've had it with you. i've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since i got here. get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
you're firin' me?
i'm firin' you? no, i'm not firin'  i'm firin' you, you -
you might regret this, mr rothstein.
i'll regret it even more if i keep you on.
this is not the way to treat people.
listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. if you did know, you were in on it. either way, you're out!  get out! go on.  let's go.
i mean, the guy is history as far as i'm concerned. history.
but you can't just fire him. webb's his brother-in-law. he's county commissioner.
so what? everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. i'm fuckin' sick of it.
this is his state. his uncle's chief judge. his brother-in-law runs the county commission. i don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  there's gotta be a way to work him back in.
phil, i can understand. you're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. i got thousands of players. i got five hundred dealers.  they're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. i have to let them know i'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing i will not catch as i am over here.
look at yours.
what?
look at that. look at this. there's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. yours is falling apart. i have nothing.
what are you talking about?
it's like everything else in this place. you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
okay, want to go with mommy?
what do you need?
you get her?  okay.  well, i need a lot. i need more than usual.
well, why don't you take it out of your account? there's a lot there.
well, i would, you know, sam. it's just that... well, i need more than that. i need twenty-five thousand.
twenty-five thousand? for yourself?
yeah.
why do you need that much?
well, what's the difference? i just need it.
well, i mean... you know, i gotta ask you. that's a lot of money. you're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. i mean...
i'm aware of that. we don't have to turn this into a big deal.  okay? we don't have to have a fight. it was important to me. but forget it. just something i wanted to do for myself.
who's fighting? i mean, i'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
huh?  well, you know what? now, i want you to tell me. i mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. i mean, what do you want? do you want a coat?
no.
well, if you want a coat, you got it. you know that. it's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  that's all i'm askin'. am i not entitled to that?
look - sam, i've been independent my whole life. i never had to ask anybody for anything. now you're making me beg you for this.
what are you talkin' a- ?
okay? and you're embarrassing me. why do want to make me feel so bad?
you're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. i'm not out to make you feel bad. i want to just be able to trust you. you now, it's about trust. i have to be able to trust you with my life. do you understand? can i trust you?  can i trust you?... can i trust you?... answer me. can i trust you?
you can trust me.
good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
what does that mean? no, i know that look. what does that mean?
it means i got the money.
you got money. that's a - that's a good look.
she's my wife.  look at me. you did know that, didn't you? you knew that she's my wife? huh? hey, look at me.
yeah, yeah. i know that.
you do? yeah? well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. that way you got a chance. be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. now, you want to do me a favor? get out of here. i want to be alone with my wife. get the fuck up and get out of here.
okay.
you fuckin' piece of shit.
hey, that's just fuckin' - that's bullshit. you know, you know, what the fuck?
you remember when you called him that night? when you said goodbye to him?  he didn't say, 'don't get married, i'll be right down, we'll get married.'  he didn't say that to you, did he?
no, he didn't.
didn't. no, instead, what did he say? 'fuck him. take him for everything he's got.'
tell me.
i know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
yeah, no shit.
well, you gotta understand it. he doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
no! no! i told him all about the guy before we ever got married. this is no fuckin' surprise.
oh, you did? i didn't know that.
yeah. he's just a friend of mine i was trying to help, so... so what?
you know... the first time i ever saw your guys together... i never saw him so happy. i mean, i know he's a crazy jew fuck and everything, but...
i never see - you know, i never seen him act like that with anybody else. i think he's crazy about you. i mean, he really loves you. he does.
oh, come on. i went into this with my eyes open, you know. i knew the bottom could drop out at any time. i'm a working girl, right?  you don't think i'm gonna go into a situation like this if i don't think i'm gonna get covered on the back end.
sure.
am i right?
i can see that. sure.
so, he put aside some jewelry for me. a lot of jewelry.
you mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? about how much?
mm, you want to steal it?
no. i - i'm just curious, you know. i was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. that's all.
i'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
well, there you go. but what does that tell ya? a million dollars in jewelry. does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
i should have never married him. he's a gemini. a triple gemini... duality.  gemini's the snake. you know you can't trust the snake.  i mean it.
i know what you mean.
listen, ginger... you know, this is probably not... i don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with ace.
i do.
i understand that. but, you know, i think you should try to make the best of it now. go slow, you know. see what happens.
he could have killed him! okay? he could have killed him.
he didn't have to hit him. it's not exactly like i'm sleepin' with the guy! and he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! what the fuck is that all about?
well, i guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. he's jealous and worried.
he gives a fuck what i do?
look, i'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. when i see him i'll talk to him.
okay.
all right?
yeah.  thanks.
and take it easy with this shit, will you? i mean, this can only make matters worse.
oh, come on.
you're a beautiful girl. you don't want to ruin your looks. i've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
you're so nice.
come on, now, i don't want to see you unhappy.
thanks.
yeah.
thank you.
it's all right.
mr rothstein...  i'm pat webb.
how do you do?
hey, it is my pleasure.
yeah, i heard a lot about you.
oh, thank you, sir.
hey, house is doin' well.  hey, all that money is rollin' in. i appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
no, that's quite all right.
uh, i come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. see, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, don ward is a very well-liked man in this town. he's got lots of friends here. now, his family and their money go back many, many years. now, friends vote... family and money votes. that's important to me... and you. and if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
i'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. that means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. either way, i cannot have a man like that workin' here.
before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
believe me, if i could prove it, he would be under arrest.
are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like nicky santoro?
i think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. what you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. i went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. he's weak, he's incompetent. he jeopardizes the whole place. there's not much more i can do for him.
you have got me there. old don is as useless as tits on a boar.  but, he is my brother-in-law, and i would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
i can't do that. and i appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and i do want to help you and i like to do favors, and i know who you are, but i cannot do that.
well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
i'm sorry, i can't do anything. he's too incompetent. and the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
okay, thanks.  um... you know, that's it. i'm sorry.
mr rothstein. your people never will understand the way it works out here. you're all just our guests. but you act like you're at home. let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. but that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the governor.  thank you for your time.
no problem.  sorry.
you bet.
huh?
isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
i didn't take your pills.
look - for my ulcer, i take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. and that's when i have extreme pain. i had a three-month supply. what'd you do with 'em?
you didn't have to beat him up!
what?
i was just tryin' to help him. it's not like i'm sleeping with the guy!
yeah, how do i know?
you can't make me stop caring...
what? what?!
i said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
listen.  ginger. i'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  i mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. uh, i mean... people look up to you in this town. i don't know what to think -
you know what, ace? i don't give a shit! i'm gettin' out of here.  i am.
it's okay.  look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
okay.
if not for me, at least for amy.
okay, okay.
you understand? your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. i'm gonna get you into a program. they got plenty of good ones.
i don't need one.
yes, you do. it's very discreet. there's no names in the papers. you don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
that's all you care about.  you don't care about me at all.
yes, i - yes, i do.
no, you don't.
how could you say that?  you're a beautiful woman. you're destroying yourself. you don't need that stuff. you don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. i know you better than you know yourself. you're a tiger, you're stronger than i am. and when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  you can do it.  you can do it.
oh, god. oh, god. okay.  okay... i'll try. i'll try.
i was out there with my cumma [italian- american slang for 'girlfriend'.]
your cumma? what are you doin' with your cumma?
what else? i gave her a schaff [italian-american slang for 'tap'.]
you gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
come on, go back there? i never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
what expenses?
well, i'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and i never get anything back. what the hell's goin' on?
you gotta go back out there.
well, then, from now on, i'm gonna start keepin' records.
artie, no records, artie. what are you gonna do with records? pay taxes?
well, i keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. i mean, what hell's goin' on? what are we doin' over here?
you're goin' out to las vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. what the fuck? i mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
i can't believe you're doing this.
it turned out phil green, mr integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the tangiers...
why are you doing this to me?
i'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
now, instead of the cops only lookin' at nicky, they started looking at green too. and he was supposed to be our squeaky...
hello.
listen...
no, no it's okay.
it's impossible. it's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  it's...
...very difficult to get in.
well, it's okay. i'll use the service entrance. i'll see you at nine.
hey, ace.
hey.
want something to drink? charlie you want a refill?
yeah, refill'd be great.
no, i don't want one.  hey, mr clark, how you doin'?
hi. good.
i've been trying to reach you. you're tougher to get than the president.
well, i've been busy.
yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
listen... nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, i explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
yeah.  i think i want my money back.
what're you gonna do? strong-arm me?
you know... i think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. i think in all fairness, i should explain to you what it is that i do. for instance, tomorrow morning i'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, i'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. and just about the time that i'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. and guess what?  i'll split your fuckin' head open again. because i'm fuckin' stupid. i don't give a fuck about jail.  that's my business. that's what i do. and we know what you do, don't we, charlie? you fuck people out of money and get away with it.
you can't talk to me like...
hey, you fat irish prick. you put my fuckin' money to sleep. you go get my money, or i'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
sam?
never mind fuckin' sam. this is personal.  i'll be there in the morning. you can fuckin' try me, fatso.
you think he got the point?
what're you doin'? he's a square guy, for chrissakes.  you can't treat him like that. he's gonna run to the fbi.
fuck the fbi! that prick's been dodging me for three weeks. and what is it with you?  all of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
i'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. but you were way out of line, nick. what're you doin'? where's your head?
where's my head? where's your fuckin' balls? huh? you know i'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. you know what i'm talkin' about, huh? you know!  if you're actin' like this now, how can i depend on you?  there's a lot of things gonna change out here. and if you wanna be there with me, sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
listen, nick, you gotta understand my situation. i'm responsible for thousands of people. i got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  it's all over, i'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if i don't get that license.  and believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. i plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  you know, i don't know what it is, sammy, but the more i talk to you, the more i feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
no, i don't wanna come -
you should say so.
i don't wanna come along with you.
just say so.
i'll be honest with you.
all right, fine.
i don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
fine.
...okay? i just wanna run a square joint. that's it. i just want my license. i want everything nice and quiet. that's it.
you mean, quiet like this: 'i'm the boss.'  that's quiet?
that's all taken out of context. okay.
yeah, that's out of context. okay.
i have no control over that. ronnie and billy were right there. they'll tell you exactly what happened.
well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. that looks bad.
looks bad? i'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
yeah?
every time you're on television i get mentioned. that looks bad. that looks bad.
what the fuck happened to you? will you tell me?
what happened to me? what happened to you?
yeah.
you lost your control.
i lost control?
yes, you lost your control.
look at you. you're fuckin' walkin' around like john barrymore.
all right.
a fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
all right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. i'm - i lost control?!
yeah.
you know, i didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. even your own wife.
my wife?
yeah.
now, what does she have to do with all this?
well, she comes to see me. she was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' diamond - that lester diamond incident.
all of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
no, i didn't. what good would that do? that's not the fuckin' point.
listen, i would -
the point is that she's upset. she's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
i - i would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? you wouldn't like it if i did it to you.
hey, she came to talk...
please...
...to me.
...don't do it to me...
she came to talk to me...
okay?
and i - what was i supposed to do, throw her out?
ju-just stay away from her. it's none of your business, okay? there are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
it's none of my business?
that's right, yeah.
a week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. in other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. i'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
this guy is gonna run to the fbi.
your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. that's your problem, pal.
i knew what he wanted, and i didn't want any part of it.
fuckin' walking around with a big head. you better check yourself...
nicky wanted to take over. he wanted to go after gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. there were never any witnesses.
the coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and i mean every little fuckin' thing too.
frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. do you know about that?
yeah, i heard, yeah.
yeah. everybody's talkin' about it. they're makin' a big deal out of it.
i know.
it's in all the papers.
what're you gonna do?
and i mean... that's no good.
i know.
you gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
i'll tell him, remo.
...bosses. i mean, they're smokin' their di nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [italian-american slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? while, if i wanna talk private, i gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
but, hey, what do they care, as long as i keep sendin' money back.
yeah, but they're complaining.
let 'em complain. i'm the one who's here.
i do all the work. somebody don't like it, fuck him.
it's up to you.
they want a fuckin' war, i'm ready.
peekaboo, you fucks, you.
i see you, you motherfuckers.
the problem was, nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. the fbi watched every move he made. but he didn't care. he just didn't care.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. he has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
practice enough this week, you prick?
and at the...
...worst possible time for me.
a record of the arrests...
i had my license hearing coming up and i didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
that was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
i mean, if i can't work in vegas, where am i gonna go?
you've been very open with us. i mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the commission.
well, that's all i ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
hey! oh!
oh, sorry -
what's the matter with you?
receipts and bills and... everything's here.
since when do you talk like that?
i'm sorry.
there's a lot of people here.
nance gives me trouble and i'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and i'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
again!
i didn't curse. i said 'frickin' head'.
that's enough.
i'm sorry.
i've never trusted him. and you know i got eyes...
...behind my head. they trust that scumbag, i don't. right now, the way i feel, i'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
all right, take it easy now, take it easy.
mom, i'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  ma, i'm sorry. i'm all upset.
i know, but that's enough.
you know - you know - you know what they're doin' to me?
i know it, i know it.
i can't take this no more. back and forth, back and forth.
take it easy, though.
all right, all right. but i - i -
you'll get a heart attack like that.
you know, i - i'm too upset right now. and - an end has to be put to this.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. i gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
you are right. what can i...
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
then do it the way you want.
pardon me, counselor. before you continue...
no, i want to have this marked, mr. -
...this, uh, this commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the rothstein application.
denying?
do i hear a motion seconded?
mr. chairman -
i was never - i was never your guest at the tangiers.
you were never my guest?!
that's right.
i never comped you?! i don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the tangiers?!
uh, i - i'd... i'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
liar.
mr rothstein is being very typical to this point.
he's lying.
the only time i was at the tangiers was when i had dinner with barney greenstein.
was i at that dinner? just tell me -
you were wandering around.
was i at that dinner?
you were wandering around.
was i at that dinner?
you were wandering around.
was i at that dinner?
you were in the m- you were in the building.
i was in the building!
you know damn well i was at that dinner, and you swore to me that i would have a fair hearing at that dinner! did you not?! did you not?!  well, tell me i was at least at the dinner! a-allow me that much.  give me that much at least!
yes, you were.
yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. you son-of-a-bitch. you son-of- a
good evening, everyone, i'm paige novodor.  what should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant tangiers casino executive, sam
...'ace' rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
what are you running for, bob? what are you running for?
...and hypocrisy.
don't you remember? you promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
in a  wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, rothstein followed several...
bullshit! bullshit!
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
we all have a past. you have a past, i have a past. and my past is no worse than yours. but you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
long suspected of running the tangiers without...
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
...well, i've got a large family.
how many kids do you have?
uh, i'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
eight children!
no, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
that's amazing.
there was nothing to it.  it was my pleasure.
he's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the supreme court. he really must be crazy. he's gonna go to washington with this?  he's out of his fuckin' mind.
it's a pity in this...
first of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. we're already on the list to be heard before the supreme court of the united states later this year.
these guys back home don't give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit! they want things to quiet down. they want you to walk away from -
walk away? andy, you can't be serious. how can i walk away? don't you see what's goin' on here? don't you see what's at stake?
the old man said, 'maybe your friend should give in.'  and when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. not only should you quit, you should run!
know what my problem is? every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention nicky, too. how the fuck does that help?  i mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  we had a police department who was cooperative. he's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. i mean, what do you do about that?
what do you propose?
i don't know, he doesn't listen to me. maybe he should...  get lost for a while. take a vacation. would that be so bad?
they ain't sendin' nicky nowhere.
all right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. that's all i'm saying. it's all that i'm saying.
i would forget about the maneuver. i would just get out.
i can't do that.
you know, i don't feel like playin' tennis.
...as soon as andy got back home, nicky heard about our talk in the car.
let's go to lunch. do you want to go to the riviera?
next morning bright and early, i get the call.
great.
you know, i've got to do some shopping afterwards. do you want to go?
well, you know...
you see, if a phone's tapped, the feds can only listen in...
...on the stuff involving crimes. so on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
yeah, and i get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
yeah.
meet me at three.
what - what, caesar's?
no, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.
why?
don't ask questions. just be there.
...same outfit.
but i saw something...
where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? goin' over my head?
what people?
what people! what'd you think, i wasn't gonna find out?
i don't even know what you're talkin' about, nick.
no? you said i'm bringin' heat on you?! i gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! you're ordering me out?! you better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
i didn't do anything. i mean, i didn't order you or anybody...  i only told andy stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
you want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
yeah, i said i - let the bullshit blow over for a while so i can run the casino. anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. it's not yours, it's my ass.
oh, i don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because i made that possible!
i -
i'm what counts out here! not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' tv shows! and what the fuck are you doin' on tv anyhow?!
what are you -
you know i get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  they think you went batshit!
i'm only on tv because i gotta be able to hang around the casino. you understand that. you know that. come on.
your fuckin' ass! you could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  you wanted to go on tv.
yeah, i did want to go on tv. that way i have a forum. i can fight back. i'm known. people see me. they know they can't fuck around with me like they could if i was an unknown. that's right.
you're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
me?! i wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. you brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. i mean, every time i meet somebody here, the big question is do i know you.
oh, sure. now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
no, it - it - nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did i tell you? i mean, you asked me, and i knew you were going to come out no matter what i said, but what did i tell you? do you remember what i told...
back -
...you? do you remember what i told you?
back - back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. one minute. i asked you?! when the fuck did i ever ask you if i could come out here?! get this through your head, you -
you never - ?
get this through your head, you jew motherfucker, you. you only exist out here because of me!  that's the only reason!  without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' jew ass! then where you gonna go?!  you're fuckin' warned! don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! you motherfucker, you!
do you see that? dumb jew motherfucker. grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. i know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
yeah. fuck him.
to abraham lincoln.
l'chaim. [yiddish for 'to life']
here we go. good luck.
forget about it, nick. don't let it bother you.
why, does it look like it's bothering me? what do i give a fuck?  fuckin' oscar too. all the fuckin' money i've given that prick, he don't even look over here. what's his problem?
mm.
fuckin' jews stick together, don't they?
they're havin' a good time too.
so are we.
sam, we got a problem.
what is it?
the little guy. he's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
now, he's really pissed.
oh, no.
he wants a fifty-thousand marker.
no, just - just give him, give him ten. that's it. ten.  i'll be right down.
he's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
he's here.
you should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
what are you doin'? you gotta get out of here!
hey, sammy, tell this jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
nicky, nicky, you're not listenin' to me. i'm here to help you. what's the matter with you?  you're gonna bury us both.
just give me the money. fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, sammy.
i'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
sue me, you jew fuck!
let's get out of here.
what? get out of here? i got a marker comin'.
i mean she's only sober about two hours a day. it's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. and if i gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? she's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  where would you be then? comin' right back to me, right back to me.  or finding some other excuse to come and i - i -
we had a deal. remember that?  he said if it didn't work out between us, that i could get my things and i could leave.
look in my eyes. look in my eyes.
m- uh, mr. and mrs. rothstein?
hey, little dale evans.
hello.

i don't want to go to europe. i want to go to see the elephant man.
we're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
we'll go later.
we're going to europe. let the adults talk.  you dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. right? you're the mother. how much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
i don't want to go to europe.
shut your mouth!
you know where she gets this from!
you shut up.
no, you - you want me to come over there? i'll smack your face.
don't give me any of your shit!  okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
lester - he called you here.
right.
here.
he was just on the phone.
he called you right here.
i just talked to him.
so, he knows where you are. that means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
ginger... it means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. now, i -
that's - yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. that's what he's -
he's sittin' by the phone -
what do you think we're gonna do? he's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
get your bag! come on, get your bag! get your things! let's go!
it's this bullshit. it's just bullshit right here. this is the fuckin' problem, you know.
oh, what bullshit? what, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
you're done yakkin', okay? you're done yakkin' now?
go! go! get in the car! go!
'go! go! go!'
you just relax. nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
no, i really do. i think he's gonna kill me.
you just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and i'll see what i can do.
yeah, uh-huh... okay.
so, i'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
i'll be there.
and listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? you all right? okay.
bye.
just knock it off! would you two knock it off? get in the car.
she started it. she started the whole thing. i'm just standin' here.
you're not gonna drive. don't even think you're gonna drive.
no, i'm gonna drive.
no, i'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
you're driving me nuts!
ginger called me.
yeah.
i just told you. she called me.
and what'd she want?
she was afraid to call you.
yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got amy.
well, that's why i'm here. she wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. what do you want?
i know. why didn't you come to me? i mean, this is family, it ain't business. meanwhile, you make calls back home. sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what i mean? back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. am i right?
i don't know. what am i gonna do with this woman? i don't know...  she's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
i think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
she's driving me fuckin' crazy.
well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  but get the kid back here. she wants to come back. that's the, uh, that's the main thing here. you want your kid, don't you? huh?
hello.
hi, it's me.  just who you wanted to talk to, right?
listen...
...uh-uh-uh - i'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put amy on a plane. just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...please. that's all i'm askin' you.
do you... i mean... i don't think she should go by herself.
what do you mean?
what i mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if i came back... do you think you could forgive me?
uh,  i don't know. i gotta tell you, i don't know.
right.
i under-understand that. i-i know i fucked up.
what about the money? uh, where's the box?
i gotta tell ya...
...i-i... made some mistakes and i spent some money.
what's it...
...under?
pretty serious.
how serious?
it's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
it's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
yeah.
and...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
yeah, yeah, i got the rest.
okay, no big deal. that's okay. yeah. he got his twenty-five.  that i'll live with. any more i couldn't.
okay?
all right...
so, what'd ya do with it?
with what?
with the money.
he needed some clothes.
twenty-five thousand for clothes.
he wanted a watch, too.
twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
mm-hm.
mm-hm.
the good part was, i had amy back. so, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, i calmed myself down and we went to dinner. i tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  but... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? that doesn't make much sense.
first of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. but let's say he did, which he won't. how you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  i, um, i mean, how could you get fitted that fast? i can't get fitted that fast, and i pay twice as much.
i bought him a watch too.
yeah.
yeah.
but even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
yeah.
at the most, which is impossible for him.
plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. that still leaves what?  around ten thousand?
would you knock it off, sam?
i'm just tryin' to figure it out.
there's nothin' to figure out. i'm home... we're workin' it out.
yes, i want to kill you! i hate your fuckin' guts!
you hate my guts? i want you to come with me now.
get off of me! stop it!
come with me now! come with me now. come with me now. i want you out of here.
i want you out of here! i want you out of here!
let go of me! let go of me!
take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
i'll go, but i want my money right now!
the arrangement is over!
no kidding. no kidding!
and i still get my money. i need some cash right now. you can't just put me in the street.
i'll get your cash. you haven't been straight with me ever since i met you! you never loved me in the first place!  i need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
you're lower than a dog!
fuck you!
here. here. is this enough money?! huh?  will it last you two fuckin' days? take it, greedy bitch.  take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
i'm going to the bank and i'm getting my jewelry too!
yeah, no kidding. good! it opens at 9 a.m. be there!
and don't send your guys down there to stop me! i mean it.
stop! you aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
you'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. just get out of here.
fine.  i'm takin' amy.
you're not takin' amy.
i am. i'm wakin' her up right now.
you're stoned. you're a junkie. get out of here.
i am not! she's my daughter too! goddamn you!
get out of here!
oh. have a good day at school.
okay.
i mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... i mean, it's none of my business, but i ... i think that's what you gotta do. you gotta take it somewhere -
oh, you're right, i know.  it's... well, i was just -
what? what?
nothin'.
what were you gonna say? go ahead.
i don't -
tell me what you were gonna say. go ahead.
yeah?
yeah.
well, i was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  there's a lot of money in there. lot of money in there, and i'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
let me think about that.
okay.
see who i got in there. gotta get somebody i can trust.
mm-hm.
you know?
yeah. 'cause, you know,  he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
hm.
he holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
yeah, right. that's sammy. and he's probably got it there too.
he's so fuckin' lucky. i could have buried him. i could have gone to europe and taken the baby. and then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
no, he wouldn't. i would have.  and he'd've been right, too. i mean, seriously.  well, there's one thing you don't do. you don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
i didn't.  i didn't. i mean, i did, but then i did exactly what you told me to do, and i came right back.
you did. you're right.
exactly.
you did. i like that. i like that. that's what i like about you. you did the right thing.
i did what you told me to.
yes, you did.
'cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
yeah.  boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
sure did.
everything went to his head.
no, he's not.
he really thinks who the fuck he is, i'll tell you that.
exactly.  he hates me.
he hates my fuckin' guts.
come on, come on, you're a toughie. you can take this.  don't cry.
i'm not as tough as you think i am.
yes, you are.
i'm not and he scares the shit out of me. i never know what he's gonna do.
come on. don't be scared.
i need some help. i do. i need some help.  you gotta help me. i need a new sponsor, nicky.
i do. i need a new sponsor.
is that what you want?
yeah.
a sponsor.
yeah.
mm... okay. don't worry about it. nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. i'll take care of ya.
nicky, please...
yes, i will. it's what you want, isn't it? huh?
thank you. yeah, yeah, yeah.
it's what you want?
yeah. uh-huh -
hi. you didn't answer your beeper.
i threw it away.
you threw it away?
look, i tried to do this thing. i know that you want me to, but it's just - you know, i'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. you know, i'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. i don't want to do it anymore.  where's amy?
i put her to bed.
oh.  i got your cigarettes.
oscar wants you to call him.
so, who'd you go to lunch with?
with jennifer.
and where'd you go?
to the riviera.
what'd you have?
i had a... salad.
what did jennifer have?
she had the same.
okay. i want you to call jennifer and i want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and i'm gonna listen in on the other line.
why do you want to do that?
you know why i want to do it. just do it.
fine.  just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
mm.
hello.
hello, jennifer, it's sam -
all right... i didn't have lunch with jennifer.
who were you with?
i was with somebody.
i know you were with somebody. who was it?  i just hope it's not someone who i think it might be.  i just hope it's not them.
...she did what she did and i did what i had to do. but, jesus, nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
what if he won't stop?
i mean, it could get us both killed.
i can back him off.
frankie, i want to ask you something.
it's private... but i want you to tell me the truth.
of course, remo.
i want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
i always tell you the truth, remo.
frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the jew's wife, would he? because if he is... it's a problem.
what could i say? i knew if i gave the wrong answer, i mean, nicky, ginger, ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
because there's one thing about these old timers: they don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. it's bad for business.
so, i lied... even though i knew that by lyin' to gaggi, i could wind up gettin' killed too.
no. i ain't see anything like that.
are you sure?
i'm positive.  remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
yeah, i know. that's why i'm asking. you see, my main concern is nicky.
hm.
i want to know... if he's doin' all right. if he's okay.
he's good. he's fine.
i'm askin' you, frankie, to keep an eye on nicky. do it for me.
no problem.
you see... i wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. you understand?
i understand.
okay.  frankie, you're a good boy.
you must have drunk too much.
go fuck yourself.
...stupid things.
watch it, partner, watch it!
the worst was blue.
...been right, but who knows?
jesus christ! what gun? he's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
what do you want? it - it's pitch- black out here. it's tin foil.
pitch-black?! it -
it looked like a fuckin' gun!
you - you fuckin' moron, i'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
oh my god, what are we gonna do? i'm sorry.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
walk, walk, walk. what'd you say?
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
yeah, what'd you tell him?
i told him i didn't know nothin'. but jiggs and, uh, tony gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
you think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
nah. you would've heard somethin'.
yeah, what's to stop him?
i know. i know.
i don't trust him anymore. but they'd never okay anything, you know?
yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
well, now, sure they're askin'. they earn with the prick. i got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  i'm not sure yet, you know. but i w- you know, but you know what i want you to do?
what?
who's this guy? who's this guy?
oh, he ain't nobody.
you know what i want you to do? get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
angelo and buster.
yeah, but i'm not sure yet.
they'll do it.
and when i'm ready, i'll say the words, 'go see the jew.'
yeah.
and you make it disappear, you know what i mean?
yeah, just let me know. but you gotta be ready. you know what i'm talkin' about?
did i say to do anything yet? i said i'm not sure... i'll let you know. i want to think about it. where're these pricks at?
don't know.
dominick said they're in the motel?
yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. i don't know. they're all over the joint.
hello? hello! ginger.
help, daddy!
amy! amy, open the door!
i can't! i'm tied!
wh-wh -
dad!
what happened? what happened? who did this to you?
mommy.
i'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, i'll -
oh, no, please, please.
when did this happen, honey?
i don't know.
you don't know? what time did your mother do this? when did she leave?
i don't know.
ohhh...
hello.
