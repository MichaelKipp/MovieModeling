where the hell were you?
late.
i can see that. don't you know this is a big deal?
i don't think she's such hot stuff.
when are we going out?  you and me?
not tonight.
you going with patrick?
mom, michael won't talk to me.
shouldn't he be at home?
do i have to talk to those two?
my boss and your boss.  sure.
hello, hello.  it went well, i thought.
very impressive ceremony.  good speech.
thank you, thank you.  you know my son, don't you?
fantastic lady.  don't know what i'd do without her.
me neither.
y'know, brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
all of us thank you, okay?
can i go swimming?
no.  find your brother, okay?
how old is your cousin?
seventeen.  she's a senior.
i'm not crazy about blind dates.
they're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
that's awful.
what the hell.  did your mom put all this together?
yeah, it's her job.
is she responsible for the punch?
no.
good.  it's terrible.
my cousin will be here tomorrow.
great.
get a dance yet?
nope.
me neither.
who'd you ask?
tina wilcox.
you're crazy.  she's ed's girl friend.
doesn't hurt to ask.  sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
that's a crock of shit.
i know.
no class.
none at all.  i wonder what the brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
why?
because they're playing our song.
may i have this dance?
sorry, i'm all booked up...  come, m'dear.
remember 1959, the jersey shore?
and how.  i thought you wouldn't respect me.
i did, i did.
listen -- what are you doing later?
fooling around?
right.
let's get the kid home.
home it is.
mmmm.
mmmmmmorning....
sean's awake.
door's locked.
good.
mrs. silvera?
mrs. silvera.
need a ride?
as far as the office.
some people.
what's daddy doing?
hey!  that's my boss!
better yet.
wait a minute....
too late, it's written.
heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
good morning!
aren't you off-duty?
till noon.  this is on my own time.  hi, shorty.
on your own time?
happy to do it.
then check it out.  i'll be in the office.
where to?
no place special.  just hanging out.
sailing?
you're not going out right away, are you?
waiting for andy.
i want you to meet my cousin.
i will, i will.
i don't need you.  andy's here.
you always go with andy.
how was dive class?
same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. there sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
shells and lobsters and stuff?
mostly old garbage.  today we found a '48 hudson.
do i have to play with the little kids?
yeah.  go on, beat it.
who's that?  quick -- i'm in love.
i hope that's the cousin.
over here.  i want you to meet somebody.
lucky.  lucky, lucky, lucky.
how fast does this go?
with the right wind, 15-20 knots.
what?
coming up!
gangway, turkies!
we're carrying weight.
we'll take your supercargo.
is that me?
that's you.
i've never been supercargo.
rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
figure they split?
happens every season -- someone takes off.  once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
chief....
hendricks.  i want to go over your reports and your form 908.
i never heard of a 908.
i just made it up.  it means, "get me out of there."  what the hell's that?
diver's camera.  tom andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
abandoned?  it's a little early in the season for that.
rich people.  home port is newport, rhode island.
if i had a $100,000 boat, i sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
if you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
did you ever see a dolphin?
sure.  they like to play.  we may see some today.
great!
whoops, almost lost one.  can't play with the dolphins without skis....
ready?
hang on, hang on...okay, go.
take a break for a minute, okay?
huh?
eddie, can we do that?  can we go skiing?  we can use my uncle's boat.  eddie?
next week.
with you, everything's next week. i want to go skiing soon.  tomorrow?
terry!  you okay?
help!  help!
okay, okay, coming....
chief brody -- can we go?  please?
oh, yeah.  sure.
how much longer?
until we find something.
i don't care about the overtime, i'm hungry.  and cold.  and most of all, bored.
about damn time.
what the hell is it?
what is it?
power line.
oh, great.
it comes here from cable junction.
untangle it and let's go -- we don't need a blackout on the island.
now you're talking.  let's get out of here before we do find something.
you have to smoke so early in the morning?
it's good with coffee.
so's a donut.
i want fruit loops!
eat cheerios.
you eat cheerios.  i want fruit loops.
eat cheerios.
what're you guys doing today?
i don't know about him -- i'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
every day?
what else is there to do?
you could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
do i have to?
you'll have to make up your own mind about that.
where's my day book?
in the den.
why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
because, i'm in the middle of a boating accident, i got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a chief deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   he's another one.
one what?  ah-ha!
boat nut.  what is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
it's an island.  got to run.
i'm going.
what about tennis?  riding? fixing up old cars?  bartending?
bartending?  i'm 17.
okay, not bartending.  why on the water every day?
because.
look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
i'll be careful.  i'll see y'later.
don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  we've had a lot of trouble.
okay, okay.
can i go with you today?
you stay with mrs. silvera, tootsie. okay?
where're we going?
oh, out a ways.  maybe the lighthouse.
the lighthouse?
no big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
what's the lighthouse?
it's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  we sometimes hang out there, you know....
great.  i got some wine.
the lighthouse is a make-out spot.
now i really want to see it.
you going to fool around with mike?  well, i'm not doing anything with him.
come on back up here!
nope.
give me back my hat!
double nope!
why'd they decide to move?
too hot in the lighthouse?
too hot tor those two?  i can't believe it.
is there something i don't know about?
i told you, remember?
oh, yeah.  so why aren't they doing it now?
maybe by now they are.
they're moving pretty fast.
as soon as i heard about it, i called you.  this thing is big! his arms indicate big.
after we've looked, we'll talk.
look at that:
first things first.
length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
come on, let's check the bite radius.
the what?
bite radius.  you know, the size of the mouth?
the whale's mouth?
the shark's mouth.
what shark?
the shark that did this.  it was a shark, wasn't it?
we don't know that, do we?
but that's what we're here to find out, right?
you don't tell me my job, and i won't tell you about yours, okay?
you stay here a minute.
oh, c'mon.
you heard me.
we'll be over by the lighthouse.
i'll be right there.  wait up.
could be a shark.  but maybe not.
look, i know a little bit about sharks.
do you?
i know that this was probably a great white shark.  car-cadon... caradan....
carcharadon carcharias.
that's it.
okay, so that's it.
is there one in these waters?
what makes you think there might be?
because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
this is a mammal, not a fish.
jesus, don't quibble with me.  i want to know if a great white shark did this.
probably.
that's it?  probably?  look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
and sound.
sound?
sound.  like sonar, or radar. they home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
so there's one around here.
not necessarily.  these wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  none of them are immediately fatal.  currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
we got a helluva tide this month.
could you just keep that crowd back, please?
pop....
you stay right here.  you're going in with me.
it's either a great white, or another killer whale.
can't you tell?
not when it's like this.  this animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
look -- can great white sharks communicate?  send out signals, or something?  you know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
don't be ridiculous -- sharks don't take things personally.
i'm showing summer rentals.  we got a helluva season going.
we have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
we're alone.
larry, i don't know how to say this, but i think we got a shark problem. a real one.
are you serious?
of course.  look -- i've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
no one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  be realistic.
i got a feeling.  i have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
of course i can, but can't it wait? these things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
we have to do something.
we have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
i know, i know....
and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  in new england? we all lost on that one.
it's still a good idea.
martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
please, larry -- there's good reason. those water skiers....
a tragedy.  but that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
two of them are still missing!
there's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  are they all shark victims?
maybe they are!
bullshit.
bullshit?  i'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
what am i, an ass?  when you called me, i called elkins, and her bosses. nothing she saw is proof of anything.
someone has to do something.
don't push it this time.  if you do, it won't turn out the way you want, i guarantee you that.
chief?
in here.
i missed you at the funeral home. santos said you were here.
you didn't miss much.  christ, what a mess.
positive i.d.?
the woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
oh.
what about that camera?
what camera?
that one -- from the wreck.  you brought it up, did you look inside it?
well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
if there is, develop it!
you got it.
i know just where to go.
not the drugstore!
of course not,  they're closed. phil fogarty's place.  he'll do it for me.
the drugstore's closed?  what the hell time is it?
nine-thirty, ten maybe.
shit -- i'm late for dinner... close up, okay?
oh yeah -- i'm expecting a long distance call, very important. give them my home phone.
right.
thank you.  i'll tell him.
for me?
sort of -- mathew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora, presently in the antarctic ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
damn.
is hooper coming to dinner?
not till next year.
oh, hi -- how was dinner?
oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  where were you?
santos' place.
oww!
careful.  what's wrong?
nothing.
nothing, huh?
that's what i said.  is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
use the little brush there.  why were you at santos'?
found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
oh.  want to talk about it?
no.
terrific.
michael.
yeah?
you want to come here a minute?
hi dad.
hiya yourself.
i got something for you to do tomorrow.
i kind of had plans....
sailing?  forget it.  you're beached. grounded.  no more boats.
hey, come on....
no backtalk!  i spoke to upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  you can work until school starts.
all summer?
he wanted a job, he's got one.  i want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
i know what you're going to say.
do you?
in the city, it happened all the time -- some kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  call the cops.  what are we, immune?
it was bad, wasn't it.
the goddamn smell is always the same.
are you going to be able to sleep?
yeah.   i think so.  mike!  keep it down, for chrissake!
and if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, ellen brody here will be happy to answer them.
len, can i see you a minute?
i think we got a couple of live ones.
brody's riding his tower.
oh, shit.
wave to my son.
how the hell do we get him down. from there?
maybe nobody will notice.  let's get them back in the bus.
oh, my god....
what the hell is he doing?
you should've been out there.  you should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  there were shots fired!
he thought he had a good reason.
larry, i'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
so?  so?
so it can't be done like that.  the man's a menace, plain and simple.
look, what am i supposed to do? it's done, it's over.  we have to deal with the consequences.
i don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  i haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  believe me, it's a pleasure....
you said something about a camera.
sure, sure -- jeff hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and i didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
did you get any pictures?
well, yeah, i did, that's the funny thing.  you can't tell much from the negatives, i was going to blow 'em up.  here's a test i did....
not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  look at the diffusion, though....
what else you got?
let's see -- you got a minute?
come on, phil, don't jerk me around.
okay, okay -- stand over there....
thank god you guys were all together. i got something for you.  proof!
martin, this is kind of an official meeting
perfect.  look at this ---
chief -- the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer.
what?
is jeff hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim chief of police in your absence?
temporarily?  uh...sure....
it came up during the meeting.
look -- i just got this from phil fogarty.  it was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. it proves i was right, all along.
what are you all, blind?  it's a shark.  look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
is that what it is?
you're damn right that's what it is.
martin, it could be anything.
what the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  jesus, it's right there in front of you. i know what a goddamn shark looks like, i've been through it, don't you understand?  i've seen this sonofabitch before!
what have you seen before?  this is nothing.  seaweed.  mud.  some- thing in the lens.
my ass!
be reasonable, please....
forget it, he won't listen.
there is nothing to discuss.
will you listen to this man? will you just listen to him?  you really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, god knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  that could ruin us.
is that what it is?  dollars? money?  i'll pay for it.  take it out of my salary.
you don't make enough.
maybe i don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but i don't work the same way.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means i don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means i know who's out to screw me here, and it means that i know something none of you know because i've been there -- and i don't want to go through that horror again.  ever!
martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
go ahead, whatever it's worth.
hi.  i closed a sale today, without len.  that's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
that's great.
sean's asleep.
that's great too.  gorgeous.
what's wrong?
ooohh, nothing.  i just got fired, that's all.
what?
what'd i say?
that you were fired.
then that's what i meant.  fired. canned.  out on my fanny.  the selectmen just made hendricks the new chief of police.  just like that.
because of today?  the beach?
no sweat.  a blessing in disguise. back to the city, you can go to bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  me, surrounded by water...ridiculous.
stop that!  we're not going any place.  you love it here.  tell me what the hell happened!
showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn shark, big as life. they didn't see it.  not like me. not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...he's out there, somewhere... i shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
honey, this is nothing...i don't know what it is.  what did they....
...everybody wants the job.  no one wants the authority. except hendricks.  fine.  he can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  call me in new york...tell him to kiss my ass....
they have no right to treat you like that.  you've given them every- thing.  for four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
fired me!  i'm not a hysterical man.  i'm responsible.  i know what i saw....
i know you did....
i try.  goddamnit, i tried...now, i'm tired...i can't keep fighting it...i'm too tired...i'm...i'm....
that's what i want -- a gaff rig.
gaff rigged?  why not a staysail schooner?  go anywhere.  look at this -- the mayan, an alden schooner.
who wouldn't.
anyone want to go the lighthouse?
i'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
i'm not sure i can.
it'll be fun, come on!
maybe you and brooke could come over to the town beach....
no way.  everybody's going sailing. if you don't want to take me, just say so.
that's not it.  my dad told me not to go.
you do everything your parents tell you?
no.
good.  i'll be on the dock at eight.  eight o'clock, everybody!
she just likes to tease.  i think she really likes you.
great.
you're going out.
yeah.
you're going sailing.
maybe.
take me.
no.
i want to go with you!
quiet!  shhh!
michael....
okay, okay.  close your door.
what're you going to do today?
turn in the car.  clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
i'll give notice.
don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
if you're beached, why are we doing this?  for practice?
yeah.
then why are we futzing around the dock?  we can make a few bucks working at the beach.
look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
i'm not in the way.  andy, am i in the way?
yeah.
would you take him?
mike!  are you going out?
maybe.
i thought you were grounded.
i can go out if i want to.
you can?
you going to the lighthouse?
why not?
i could give you a dozen good reasons.
shut up.
okay, okay, don't say i didn't remind you.
come on, you guys.
well, i don't know....
for me...?
what the hell.  for you....
i thought you said she was going with us?
let's just go sailing, okay?
want to talk about it?
want to swim home?
great!  find one for me.
with butter, if they got any....
you want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
just like this.
what about sailing?
the tide's running.  it'll take us to the light.
it'll take us to budapest if you're not careful.
what about the others?
they'll be there when we get there. might even have a fire started.
what're we going to do in the mean time?
i dunno.  we'll think of something.
but first, a little juice....
and second?
mmmmmm.
wait a minute.  promise me something.
anything.  anything.
that you'll put down a blanket.  i've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my mom's getting uptight about them.
you got it.
faster!  faster!
coming about....
wheee!  faster!
how fast is enough?
i want to go faster!
you coming up on him?
you bet.  hang on....
coming up!  give way!
like hell!  we're on the starboard tack!
my hair's getting wet!
so's mine.
when do we get to the lighthouse?
soon, dark eyes, soon.
i can't wait to get there.
but of course.
hey -- it's not your job any more. i'm going to be late for work.
just one minute....
right after, the kids went out?
what kids?  who went out?
all of them.  mike, junior vaughn, brookie peters, pat, lucy -- all that whole gang.
mike?  our mike?
yep.  looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
how long ago?
about an hour, maybe two.  let's see -- i came on about eight....
what're you doing?
going out.
i can't let you take her out.
you can't stop me.
mrs. brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  neither of you can go.
i'm going.
mike's out there.
but i signed for the boat.  you' re not authorized any more.
untie that rope.
please.  it's my job.
you're too close.  back off.
goddamnit, hendricks, untie the rope there.
hurry, please.
what the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  which way are we going?
affirmative.  can you get your chopper airborne?
10-4, in a few minutes.  he's down checking a buoy in the bay channel.
get him the hell over to amity point, the old lighthouse.  right now.
what for?
there's a bunch of kids day-sailing that way.  turn them back to port.
that's it?
that's it.  just do it, all right?
10-4,   soon as i can raise him.
if they're not at the light, look for them.  i don't want them out there.  get them back to port!
affirmative, affirmative.  turn the kids day-sailing back to port.  i heard you.  patrol out.
that's fun!  let's race for some- thing!
name it.
loser sails home alone.
you're betting what you already got.
i don't care.
i love it.
sure you do -- you win either way.
i'm supposed to.
turkeys!  eat wind!
yee-hah!
mike and larry are racing! loser goes home alone!
if we beat them, they can both go home stag!  single-o!  alone! jackie can come back in this boat!
what about me?
uh.  well.  maybe you could give polo a hand going in....
your ass i will.  besides, the wind's turning with the tide. sailing back is going to be a bitch.
your dad must be really pissed.
we better go back in.
it's not going to be easy.
what's wrong?
we're fighting wind and current. i though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
putz -- that won't be for hours.
i was counting on hours.
heading back?
might as well.
they're turning around.
coming about, then.
be careful....
anything?
tina!
n-o-o-o-o-o-o....
it's okay, it's okay.  what's the matter?  tina?  honey?  hey ---
no!  it's still there!
what is it?  what's there?
it's still there!
i need a hand here....
i'm going out there.
hey -- you can't do that.
what is it?  what's the matter?
mike's out there.
about 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of sand island, and lay her north by northeast....
never mind that shit.  just point.
see where cable junction is?  look to the left.  the lighthouse.  that's it.
got it.
oh, shit.
someone pop your balloon?
no problem, no problem.
anyone know what time it is?
3:30.
what's wrong?
tide doesn't turn for three hours.
low tide at cable junction is 7:46 p.m.
what'd you do?  memorize the tide tables?
i can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
maybe it's gone.
they tend to follow moving things. maybe it's following polo and timmy.
how're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
anyone got another set of sails?
hey!
over here!
as soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  my dad's the mayor....
there's a shark....
harbor air, do you read?  over?
brody?  this is patrol base.
where the hell is air one?
that's what i'd like to know.  lost transmission at cable junction.
did he raise the kids?
last transmission said ten juve- niles.
yeah?  then what?
then nothing.  if you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
did you say cable junction?
that's what he said.
when?
1530 hours.  might still be there. base out.
sean!   catch the rope!
the rope!  the rope!
he's got to help or it won't work.
sean, baby, please....
it killed her.  it ate her.
shh.  shhh....
it's okay, it's okay....
sean!  listen!  listen to me, sean.
goddamn it, sean, you listen to me or i will kick your ass, do you hear me?
listen to andy, sean.
we're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
throw it.
sean!  catch it!
by 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  more, with this wind.
shut up.
i can't stop thinking!
mike?  is that you?
pop.  i'm sorry.
it's okay.  what happened?
i passed out, but i'm okay.
at least you're safe.  what about the others?
jesus, don't freeze on me.  what about the others?
sean's still out there.
what?
dad, i'm sorry....
stay here.  don't go anywhere. just stay here.
bring her to port a little.  that's it -- steady.
i think we're changing course a little.
we're going to die.
it's all right, we're okay.
i don't know.
what the hell, we're steering for it.
the wind drift is lateral.
what's that mean?
sideways -  for every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
but we had it!  we were headed right for it!
shit.  shit, shit, shit!
don't!
stop paddling!
but the island!
the shark.
what is it?
we're hung up on something.
easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
back down!
we're hung up here.  snagged.
can you get us a line?
hang on!
dad!  dad!
i'm okay, baby, i'm here.  it's okay....
get on the rocks!
swim for it!
they made me go with them.
