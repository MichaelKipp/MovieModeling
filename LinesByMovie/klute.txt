klute. with a k. k - l - u -
are you with plant security, sergeant?
town police.
then how are you involved?
i know tom grunemann.
you knew the subject thomas grunemann. how well?
we grew up together. kids.
can you account for his disappearance in any way?
no.
did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? indicates no. moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
no.
marital problems in general? indicates possibly -- am i right sergeant?
everybody's got some, i guess.
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york?
no.
examine this letter please.  we recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. grunemann apparently typed it friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. we have already contacted the new york police; they think they know the girl in question.
are you closing the case?
no sir, we do not state that. we are countin --
why could not you ever find out anything from the girl?
trask --
the subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. there is thousands.
inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. we have an investment in tom grunemann. the company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
private investigation, you mean. yes sir, of course you are entitled, and there is some very competent --
klute offered us his services; we have accepted.
klute knew tom. he has a great many ideas about the case --
yes sir, we know he --
we would expect him to work in cooperation with you. he would report to each of you and to our company's new york office, to pete -- pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
mr. streiger, speaking frankly -- we have appreciated the sergeant's interest you know, all along. here, locally. but new york, that is - well --
what is it?
miss daniel? my name is klute -- john klute --
what about?
my name's john klute.
you said that.
I am an investigator. I would like to ask you some questions about tom grunemann.
who?
tom grunemann. he wrote you some letters.
gee.
he was a research engineer at the tuscarora laboratories in pennsylvania. he disappeared from there last april. I have been hired to look for him.
why?
you know what I am talking about. miss daniel.
honest?
will you let me ask you some questions?
dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
you are not police or fbi; you are just a private investigator?
mm.
and you just want to ask me a few questions?
mm.
that is a lot of people to die unknown.
unknown, unidentified and unwanted. and there is more every day man, there is more everyday.
-- usual case history -- this is not a medical confidence, it is all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  oh they do not keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. why?  why do you want to know all this?
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it.
not unusual.
did she talk about him to you?
about his letters -- that is all she remembered. quite violent material, I would say, obsessive, a quite sick man. but that is not unusual either.
has she talked with you since prison?
no. she had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
i think she is trying that.
oh sure they try. the idea of a better life.  but they do not really know much about life: they get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. the trick. the trick. men in bed. not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. just the trick, the transaction.
enjoy.  well --
it is good to see you. well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
sure dear, yes.
well -- well I am just back. and -- i must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
yes?
and cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
mm.
and then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well i just saw him. a stranger -- looking at me -- and i knew suddenly that all my life I would been --
-- may i? it is so --
please --
not young; he was not young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
yes?
and nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but i felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
is it the shakedown hon? you picked a loser, i just do not have it.
no, I am look --
if i was taking calls full time would i be living in this kip? I would be back on park avenue; i could support the whole national guard!
could i ask some questions?
or you will get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
company outing or picnic or something like that.
is not that sweet.  well it could be any one of them bubi; i get to see them all.
a name. grunemann. nothing. and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. then they asked me, well had i been getting letters, from someone out there in cabbageville --
-- tuscarora --
all right, yes, i had been. those sick, wild letters -- I am watching you, going to follow you, going to punish you, kill you et cetera. well, they said, all right that is grunemann. so try to remember when you and he - when -- well i do not know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. a man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that would be about two years ago.
you remind me of my uncle.
what?  what do you remember about that -- dumper?
nothing. except he was not kidding. usually it is a fakeout, you probably know. they pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  hell it is their money. I will hang from the shower rod and whistle maytime. except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
but you can not say that dumper was tom grunemann.
i can not say he was anybody!
well could i have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you have got downstairs -- ok? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I will have a good time and--
what about everything since?
everything that is happened since tom grunemann disappeared. the phone calls and the --
just phone calls, right? they ring, you answer, they do not say anything, just blank. kids getting kicks. burglars looking for an empty apartment. i mean there is nothing that proves --
what about the other things you have reported? --  -- being followed on the --
look -- I am sorry -- I have led everybody wrong. i mean yes, i get those feelings, but that is just me, that is just feelings.  I am sure this will amuse you; I am scared of the dark. and sometimes i get shook up, i hear people or -- well, I will come out in the morning and think someone is been prying at my mailbox, or there is a little -- trash outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people would not even notice. well that is not real, it is just nerves; it is got nothing to do with --
is that how you get most of your dates? someone gives your name to someone else?
most of them.
is that how you met the dumper? -- someone else gave --
how would i remember?
how else do you meet them? pimps?
you are very square. pimps do not get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
i have some names the police gave me. frank ligourin. will you tell me what --
look, I am sure this'll amuse you too. ilia trying to get away from all that.
what about the old gentleman the other night, mr. faber?
klute, tell me, what is your bag? are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? or --
-- ok --
-- you want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
ok.
gee i hope this does not make my cold any worse.
tell me about frank ligourin.
mm? oh, he was my old man. we broke up.
what? this?
-- ok?
i thought you could trick me for those tapes. do not you get lonely in that little green room? or let me get you someone; i have terrific friends, wild.
no thanks.
you have changed your mind? you do want to play?
i do not want you to look up. there is someone on the skylight.
tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
i go on rounds.
rounds, what are they? -- do not watch me, keep talking.
you go see agents -- or equity calls, open casting calls. and ad agencies -- commercials -- you do not get work, you just go around.
well do you think it was him?
what do you think?
can not you get him?
maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper -- frank sent me on it.
do you know where he got the dumper?
he never told me.
well, let's go down and ask him.
what did you expect? frankie still has a good string, three girls. figure three hundred a week from each.
is that what you gave him?
I have always respected bree.  I would like to make something clear.
I have just got a few --
I would like to make something clear. i do not go after a girl; a girl comes to me. her choice. right?
I am looking for a man. tom grunemann.  bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. she says you sent her on it.
two years ago? sorry.
they tell me you use narcotics. could i bring someone around to look at your arms?
look -- dad -- i may stand better with the cops than you.
ok, a family matter. between the girls. i had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides bree.
she told me.
ok and one of them  jane mckenna -- she blows a little jealous of bree - you know? -- bree comes first? and evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to bree, you know, so bree'd get hurt. i did not know. till afterwards.
why did not you tell bree, afterwards?
you do not tell them. that one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  peace in the family.  beyond that, i do not know. all she wrote.
I would like to talk with jane mckenna.
would i be telling you all this? she copped out long ago. she committed suicide baxter.
did you like my friend frankie?
no.
did not he tell you what you wanted?
it did not go anywhere.  but that is not why --
about the dumper, did not he tell you that?
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper.
well -- she is dead.
i thought you were going back to the apartment.
you said you wanted these.
oh golly, oh just what I have always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  how come?
you told me what you could. i guess I am through with your part of it.
is there anything more i could --
i do not see anything, do you?
what are you going to do next?
try some other ways.
what do i do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
and i do not think that was tom.
you said it was!
no, i said what did you think.
oh -- wait -- oh i get it. you said that just to keep me scared. so I would tell you everything i -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
well --
hey, but did we get to you, klute? a little?
yeah, you got to me.
-- us city folks? the sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
oh. no. not that way. I would say it was more -- i do not know --  -- too bad? pathetic?
goodbye.
it is kind of late.
it got lonely upstairs. there is someone on the roof.
oh, do not be a doo-doo.
not much point to this, is there?
ezra, I am lots better than you are used to. tell me -- the other night, watching me with mr. faber -- was not your tongue a little bit hanging out?
mm.
so you are not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or tommy-baby --
bree -- thanks -- i do not want to.
oh do not be all hypocrite. or do you really like other kicks? is it more just having power over someone? -- so you do not really need to --
what is the matter hon? you were great. terrific. a tiger.
thanks.
well what are you down about? you mean because you did not get me there?  you can not expect that. i mean frank, yes, he would get me there all the time -- but never with a john.
you asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
when?
I have checked the records of jane mckenna's death -- i can not get anything special. but frank ligourin had another girl you said, besides mckenna and you.
arlyn page.
did she and jane mckenna know each other?
frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too.
arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she is the one who started frank. she is strung out now; you will not find her.
you could help me find her. you know the people.  I will pay you a hundred dollars.
i can make that in a lunch break!  look, hiram, you are sure it is not just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you will hang around for seconds?
do not worry.
trina this is klute. i told you about him.
oh yes mr. klute -- will not you both join me?  and how do you like our fair city? there is so much here do not you think? the museums and the books and the foreign films -- bree, have you seen the godard film?
uh uh.
oh you have got to. he does such fun things with imagery. and I have been reading the fall --  -- the fall by ahlbair camoo -- it is the same thing, you know the imagery --
trina honey, he just wants to find arlyn page.
why? she is a junkie.
she was with you after she left frank.
well she is not now.  i did everything for arlyn. i loved arlyn i took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on first. but she would not stay off it -- the junk -- and i wept and i pleaded and i held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. my clothes. we could have had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
what is the matter?
what the hell do you think's the matter.  i could wait for you someplace.
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann --
-- then you do not need me.
but if it is someone else i do.
bree -- honey - please, we are waiting for someone.
arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
can not you see I am strung out?  please, we are waiting for it -- he is got to have it!
honey, a couple of years ago, with jane and frankie? -- jane sent me a dumper --
please, if he sees you, he will not come!
arlyn, just tell me, did jane have a dumper, one of her regular johns?
what about him? yes.
did he come around often?
she would not be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
i believed her, pete.
he is right you know. waiting for the pusher, she would tell you anything.
i believed her: the dumper was not tom grunemann.
all right, suppose it was not tom grunemann; where does that get you?
it is where it does not get me. I have got nothing left that connects to anything.
then, close the case.
i better keep looking.
where, how?
i could try arlyn page again. she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel.
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. not tom, you said, the dumper was clearly not tom.
it is got to make sense some way.
I am flying back out to pennsylvania friday; I will fill them in on things.
how is it back there?
i think you are homesick.  I will be out at my camp over the weekend. nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  john, I will be back here again thursday; I will be in touch. lieutenant, thank you.
that is how the other one died, you know. in the water.
i looked it up.
well?
yeah.
i thought you ought to know, arlyn page is dead.
how?
the same as jane mckenna.
thanks for the jolly news. i thought maybe you would left town by now. you kind of just disappeared. but you boys from tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, do not you?
the next few weeks i would like to know where you are all the time.
why?
just let me know when you are going out and where --
what if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? you could sit and read the national geographic.
how can you do it to yourself?
i do not get you.
ligourin: how could you do it?
i told you before, you would not understand.
you are right, i do not understand. explain it to me.  you were scared. arlyn page, that scared you. well it should; that is death. so what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. ligourin kills women.
no.
no, no you are right, I am sorry. he uses women; he lets them kill themselves. is that how you want it?
arlyn was a junkie; I am not on junk!
no, you can find some other way.  explain it to me. bree, show me any sense to --
you get the christ out! you dumb stupid bastard, you do not know anything, you square, you get out! i do not have to show you anything; you get out!
please.
we did this before.
no.  well all right. but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right.
i do not like getting splashed.
I am still scared.  i mean different but still.  look, i made it very clear from the start, you are a yokel, you do not excite me, you do not even interest me, and so i only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
my bed.
i am scared. the things i do. the things i could do to you.
mm.
no, not just 'mm'. you do not know what i --
oh boy, say, you think you are pretty good.
yup.
i know: it is ridiculous. but it is tearing me up and i do not know why. and look, all right, i came here did not i? and if i have to, I will keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I will even pay for it, but will you kindly for god's sakes say something?
I would just be guessing.
guess!
maybe this was not just a trick. maybe you are in danger of real love, real involve --
i do not love him.
you have spent your life avoiding this. you will try hard to deny it; you are quite likely to destroy it.
all right. loneliness.  well -- separated. from other people. forgotten.  well, as if i can be here, i can go through the motions, right? but the truth is, i do not belong.
do not belong?
do you always have to repeat?
sorry.
well it is more than loneliness. hate. people hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I am all screwed up.
you think people hate you.
the truth is i hate them: they must hate me. all right, the money.  all right, not the money. a kind of put-on. it gets things back together.  well let's say I would go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. i mean before -- before i got this job -- and they would always say thank you very much and I would feel, you know, brought down. they did not want me.
did not want you.
i said that.  well, so you have a choice. you can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  so you take a call and go to a hotel room and there is some john you have never seen before, but he wants you. he must, he is paying for it.  and usually they are nervous and that is all right, too, because you are not; you know this thing. and then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you are all there is.  and it is not real and you do not have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it is all right, it safe -- you know?
think this is our guy?
i do not know. it looks familiar to me.
thought it might. it is off an arrest report you typed two years ago. man you wanted samples of everybody.
but what reason could he have? what possible reason?
unless he was involved with grunemann's disappearance.
i knew tom never wrote that letter.
what else do you know?
i never could believe that tom was a split personality. i never believed he was a dumper; and i do not believe he disappeared of his own volition; and i do not believe he is alive.
we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there is no evidence of murder - there is not even a body.
i do not believe tom's alive.
john, how are you?
I will be sending you on a report tonight.
it is a beautiful day in tuscarora - i do not envy you that humidity in the city.
it is not so bad.
would you like to know what is in it? the report.
what is in it?
i think tom grunemann's dead. I have been a lot of places - I have asked a lot of people. I have found no proof he is around. I have found no proof he was ever around.
I am sure the fbi and the police explored that possibility.
no. they never did, really. but that is what I am going to recommend. the next step. unless something --
have you discussed this with them?
it is in the report.
do they have the report? have you discussed it with them?
i wanted to give it to you first.
all right. all right --  john, just sit tight will you? I will read your report, I will discuss it with the others. I will be back next thursday, we will talk the whole thing over then. nothing til thursday, all right?
all right.
thank you. goodbye, john.
goodbye, pete.
i saw mr. faber.  you remember mr. faber, do not you?
yeah.
is that all you have to say?
what am i supposed to say?
well, i told him i would not - uh - go there any more.  i know it is tough to understand, but it was not easy. you see, he was nice to me. i mean, it was not just him. i got something out of it too i guess. anyway, i told him i would not go there anymore.
spangler says we have a relationship.
what?
you and i -- a relationship.
i was wondering what that was.
hell there is nothing so mysterious about the square life.
oh jesus. oh jesus.
do not touch anything.
oh look what he did in them.
drop it.
listen to me: it is all right. I have been expecting something.
my god, i thought it was over. and here i am, daddy, right back at the start.
bree --
right back at the start, right?
go down in my room.
you said it was over, right? you said not to worry any more, all over, right?
but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann?
because he knew i could not leave the case alone. and this way at least he would keep track of it. and me.
what about grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
gov, want to leave me that one. how come he got to play with this one, anyway.
i left them here. i was doing some work here.
it is damn lucky you did not have the dossier on cable here.
nobody's seen that.
if we get anything from the lab, we will have it by noon. and just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
sounds to me you better shake him again. put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
he called this morning from tuscarora. asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. he is on his way to chicago.
ah, schmendrick -- what is the scam?
those were police laboratory people, they have been over the apartment.
oh zippidy-doo, they will find my fingerprints.  can i go in? i need some stuff.
where did you spend last night?
with trina.
i called trina.
maybe i was not there when you called.
bree, what is actually happened? it was not that bad.
how do you know how bad it was?
why could not you stay here with me?
because i did not want to be touched! i did not think you would get that!
hey -- look officer -- i can explain everything. it was just -- you know, everything all of a --
trask wants to talk with you.
miss daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
oh well that should not take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
a few more days. we know who did this.
so do i.
no, not grunemann. he is dead. the man that killed him -- also prob'ly jane mckenna, also arlyn page.
arlyn and jane commited suicide. he said they commited suicide.
now there is a picture I would like you to --
you said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
well we are pretty --
why is not he locked up?
we do not want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
is that why klute did not tell me?
i guess he figured it was better.
what was better? i made better bait?
no, that is not --
is that what he set me up for? everything he is told me from the beginning? -- do not worry, do not --
from the beginning i do not know why the hell he is messin with you. if he was me he would know better. if he was even a city boy he would know better. you are a whore miss daniel, that is the truth of it, right? now somethin I would like you to look at.
i do not have to look at anything. i do not have --
here please.
oh no.
like for you to look for the man.
grunemann? I have looked at him a --
sorry we had to meet here. but I am pressed for time.
well there is a couple --
i read your report. i had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, tom being nowhere around --
well as a matter of --
I have been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. i do not even have a telephone there. this morning they sent a messenger out, that you would been trying to call me.
yeah.
I am on my way to chicago. very important meeting tonight. well -- any new developments?
yeah, two things pete, that --
you said trask was arranging laboratory work. police laboratory. anything from that?
yeah. it was not tom.
I am sorry. i do not understand.
it was not tom that broke in the room.
it has to be tom. you said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
not tom. whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, i told you, in her clothing. semen. the laboratory got a blood group reading from that. the man was blood type 0; tom was an ab.
some mistake perhaps that --
no. no mistake pete. it does not prove who it was -- but proves it was not tom.
you must be discouraged.
not too bad. this brings back that dumper in the picture.
that who?
dumper, the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew.
you said he was no possible connection with tom. the page girl told you that, not tom.
someone is been doing all these things.
you were hired to look for tom, not someone.
pete, I have got a chance to buy jane mckenna's black book.
what?
call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. sometimes, if a girl retires, she will even sell it worth good money. jane mckenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I have been after it a long time.
you were hired to look for tom.
I am meeting a man tomorrow night. he wants to meet me on east-river drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. can you get that for me pete?
i can not follow you.
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckenna's list of clients?
no. it is ridiculous. this has nothing to do with tom grunemann.
it probably has the dumper's name. it might give us some kind of new lead.  i want a look at it anyhow.
klute, the company's interest is tom grunemann. solely and exclusively. you say you can not find tom; all right, I will see that you are paid off; the case is closed.
all right, but I am going to see that list.
i can talk it over; possibly i can get the money. when are you meeting the man?
tomorrow evening, nine. east river drive and 73rd street.
suppose i meet you there a half hour before.
just send me a money order.
no, I would -- like to be in on it.
well --
tomorrow. see you tomorrow night.
please. i said i do not want you to do this.
trask said i should move. let's not make a thing of it.
-- i have to close up now. leave your name and number with his message service, mrs. daniel, and why do not you just go home and wait until he --
no.
well i have to close up now.
look -- could i use your phone?
yes indeed.
look. i almost killed my -- i almost killed someone.
well I am certain doctor spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
can not we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  i know you are expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
yes -- all right --
-- we can talk --
-- yes.
all right, then, an ordinary matter. I am a quite well off man, i have a -- position to respect. i would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I am sure you understand. do you? well I would like to buy jane mckenna's book.
you have no idea what I am talking about.
yes -- jane mckenna's book -- i could make a phone call.
no, you are frightened, you are pretending. well -- klute knows about me then. does everybody know, can you tell me?
yes.
then it does not matter what i do any more, does it?
I am not going to hurt you, absolutely, I am not.
will you let me go then?
it puzzles me so badly. I have done terrible things but i can not consider myself a terrible man. I have killed three people and I would still want to say it was accident, do you see?
if you will let me go i could tell them what --
tom grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with jane mckenna. then i suppose it was the -- the contempt i saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me. within the company. i endured that as long as i could, do you see?
I am sorry, I am just frightened. yes.
excuse me miss daniel?
i said yes, i see.
oh no, i do not think --
tell me. I will listen.  i just want you to tell me.
i got a call from ross this morning. cable owned a plot of woodland -- he would go there on weekends. they found tom grunemann's body buried there. they have notified his wife.
oh.  well it was not us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
mm.
you are going back?
mm.
well suppose i had not come downstairs. would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
no. i was going to come up. i wanted to ask you to marry me.
you wanted to, or you are?
i am.
you could at least look at me!
look -- yes. i mean thanks, but -- do not you think we better be realistic?
about what?
look at me. I am pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear god I would tear your heart out!
i do not think so.
how can you not think so? you know the things i can do.
they do not scare me any more.
what?
does not scare me. i think we could handle it.
look, why should it be yes or no? can not we keep it going and see? i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. people do that, that is realistic.
ok.
you do not believe that either, do you? why can not you see my side?
can you use these?
can i carry something for you, to the car?  will you kiss me?
no. I am sore.
