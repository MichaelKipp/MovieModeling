well. i got some stuff to say. guess I am kind of lucky that way. most people do not have anything on their minds, do they?
oh, incidentally, my last name is carruthers. sounds a little too much like "druthers", does not it?
it is okay.
well, nobody asked me what i thought. they just hung it on me.

nah, i got me a job.

well, i do not mind getting up early, so i got a job throwing garbage... I am not in love with the stuff, okay.
that is my father. i got to run.
hey, wait a minute. when am i going to see you again?
well, i know what my daddy's going to say.

well, that i should not be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
he will say that?
yeah.
now what is he know about garbage, huh?
nothing.
there you go.
well, i mean there is nothing he wants to know about it... I have got to run.
you ever held another job before?
i used to throw trash for the city.
you lost that one?
would not be here if i hadn't.
what kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
i can not think of anything at the moment... I would like you to write me out a slip, though, proving i came down here.
hi.
well, stop the world.
quit my job.
great.
just seemed like the right move... whatcha doing?
spanish.
how do you say "quit my job" in spanish?
something mi trabajo.
yeah, well, I am going to work as a cowboy now... or thinking about it. it is a routine, like anything. what do you think?
i do not know.
you want to go for a ride?
well, i got homework.
bring it along.
you are a redhead.
i know.
anybody ever call you "red"?
yeah, but i do not like it.
why not?
just don't... I have got a headache.
yeah?
can i come around and see you tomorrow?
okay.
what a nice place.
yeah, the tree makes it nice.
and the flowers... let's not pick them. they are so nice.
it is your play.
my stomach's growling.
there is an old fudgesicle over there. you want it?
no.
somebody else is going to get it.
i do not care.
kids eat that kind of stuff in korea.
did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
yeah.
is that all there is to it?
yeah.
gosh, what was everybody talking about?
do not ask me.
you know what i think?
what?
that we should crunch our hands with this stone. that way we would never forget what happened today.
but it would hurt.
well, that is the point, stupid.
do not call me stupid.
okay, but I am going to keep it for a souvenir...
sure is pretty.
what did you come out here for?
i was not aware there was any law against it.
you know, before i met her, nobody could ask me how i was doing with my girl. matter of fact, i did not really have one.
is that right?
yeah.
listen. i got a lot of respect for her, sir.  that is about as good a one as i know to tell you.
well, it is not good enough.  just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, kit? guy like you.
she would get along okay. and if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, i would not mind... I would always tell people i deserved it.
hi.
what are you doing?
I have got a gun here, sir. it is always a good idea to have one around.
what do you think you are doing? go on, get out of here.
well, i got it all planned... and I am taking holly off with me.
what for?
for coming onto my property... with a gun.
no, you are not either.
yeah? why not?
cause i can not allow it.
i came in the front.
how bad off is he?
i can look and see.
we better call the doctor... listen. I will say how it happened, part i saw.
well... i do not think that would work.
are you sure?
you do not believe me, see for yourself.
listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
you said that once already... too late now.
why?
they are not going to listen to me. you either. are you kidding?
suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
would not be funny... listen, I will be back in a while.
how you doing?
I am fine. kind of tired.
yeah, me too.
"the kon-tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. we had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. i thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
he was nervous.
how you doing, cato?
not bad.
what you been doing?
running this place for a fella in town. nothing much to speak of.
well, i do not notice us hustling trash, either.
where did you get them antlers?
they come with the house.
yeah, i guess.
she plays the clarinet, too.
do not you ever get bored around here?
sometimes. the other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old spanish coins.
that is what he told you, huh?
no, he showed me one.
what did they look like?
kind of round, like so... gold. I will show you if you want.
kit... maybe I would better get a shovel.
okay.
I will catch up with you.
okay.
i found a lid. it was laying on the ground over there.
put that down. it is dirty.
look at all this junk.
how is he doing?
i got him in the stomach.
is he upset?
he did not say anything to me about it.
whatcha looking in there for? we can not afford any of that.
just looking.
that your spider in there? in that bottle?
yeah.
what do you feed him?
oh, flies... grasshoppers when i can catch 'em.
does he bite?
he never bit me.
hi. where is cato?
well, he is gone.
gone?... where?
he said not to tell.
oh yeah?
yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. you are the ones with the studebaker, are not you?
no... you go in there, I will have to kill you.
what is going on?
can not afford to take chances.
nah, skip that... I am going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
okay.
you do not mind?
what is going to happen to jack and me?
you have to ask kit. he says frog, i jump.
okay.
what is your friend's name?
jack.
you love him?
i do not know.
I have got to stick by kit... he feels trapped.
yeah. i can imagine.
well, I have felt that way, had not you?
you promise to stay down there for an hour?
yeah.
you expect me to believe that?
think i got 'em?
i do not know.
well, I am not going down there and look.
what did you put him in there for?
just to keep him out of the sun.
you tired?
yeah.
yeah, you look tired... listen, honey. when all this is over, I am going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
i do not want a steak.
well, we will see about that... hey, lookie.
later we found out she was deaf and we had not even known it.
excuse me.
hi.
yes?
this your place?
yes.
sorry to barge in on you. anybody else here besides you two?
no.
good deal... oh, uh, we are on the run and we would like to hang out here for a while. couple of hours, maybe. how did that be?
stay as long as you like.
hi.
hi... ah, mister scarborough here?
yeah, but the thing about him, he is down with the flu. he is sick.
really?
yeah. I would invite you inside, except it is contagious. do not want to start an epidemic.
no, of course not. it is only that he called last night and asked if i could come by.
well, he did not have it last night.
what is that?
well, I would like to leave a message, if that is okay.
sure.
hi, whatcha doing?
just thinking.
good a way to kill time as any... she okay?
yes.
listen, ah... we are going to take the cadillac for a while. how did that be?
fine.
do not worry, i will not let her drive.
you are my friend, are not you?
yes.
okay, no monkey business then.
hey, why are you always walking ahead of me?
well, why you always walking behind me?
don't.
anybody ever done that to you before?
no.
positive?
yes.
guess there is no way I will ever know. for sure.
I would like to get out of here.
soon as i start the car... and fix my hat.
"rumor: pat boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. fact: pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it is the education that will have to take the back seat."
i do not blame him.
"rumor: frank sinatra and rita hayworth are in love... fact: true, but not with each other."
that is montana over there.
i never been to montana... acquaintance of mine has, but i hadn't... never had any reason to.
why not? i mean, I am having fun... at least I am not bitching.
well, i feel kind of like an animal living out here. i mean, there is no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
well, I will catch you a big trout. soon as we get to the mountains.
everybody loves trout.
I am serious.
maybe we should have tried to hop it.
it was going too fast.
i could have pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
yeah, then we would be stuck here.
well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I am not saying that i know.
well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. we ought to find a more flat place.
how about over here?
never mind. it does not matter... if I am worth a damn, I will pick the right direction. and if I am not, well, i do not care. see what i mean?
no.
well, i should not expect miracles, should i?
what?
nothing... i was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I am sorry. i was not listening.
you know... they would probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
well. I am not going to let that stop me.
you smoke pall mall?
yeah.
morning... say, you got any gas?
maybe.
well. I am sorry, sir, but we have got to ask you for it.
see, we are about out... been driving all night. actually, i do not even have time to explain it to you.
well, matter of fact, i do not have any.
just a second now. that is your truck. is not it?
you did not walk out here.
it is mine all right.
well, listen. I am going to swap you my cadillac.
who are you?
name is carruthers. believe i shoot people every now and then. not that i deserve a medal.
okay, friend. start running.
just gimme a chance.
git.
boy. i had a feeling today was going to be the day... helicopter.
yeah.
he is not coming to take us for a ride, either. come on, let's make a run for the car.
have you got a better idea?
i just do not want to go.
what?
hi.
hold it right there.
i could have held off an army if i could have gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
oh yeah?
long as my ammo held out... right there is where you caught me.
we did it, ray.
you better not leave that cadillac sitting out here.
think I will take the juice?
beats me.
say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
thirty aught six.
you ever had to open it up like that before?
nope.
you tossed my hat out the window.
wanta sue me?
no.
kit... kit, I have got a question for you.
mmmmm.
you like people?
they are okay.
then why did you do it?
i do not know. always wanted to be a criminal, i guess. just not this big a one... takes all kinds though.
hey, listen, tom, i do not mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. what do you say now?
i need to get your signature on some papers here, kit.
well, I have got to read them first. suppose i could get a coke while i do?
sure thing. come on.
holly's over here, kit, if you want to see her.
sure.
course it is too bad about your dad.
yeah.
we are going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
well, kit...
tom...
good luck to you.
thanks.
i mean it.
i know you do. good luck to you, too.
