catch!
what do you mean?
hi, i'm kit. i'm not keeping you from anything important, am i?
no.
well, i was just messing around over there, thought i'd come over and say hello to you.  i'll try anything once.  what's your name? i said mine.
holly.
listen, holly, you want to take a walk with me?
what for?
well. i got some stuff to say. guess i'm kind of lucky that way. most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
oh, incidentally, my last name is carruthers. sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
it's okay.
well, nobody asked me what i thought. they just hung it on me.
you still in school?
nah, i got me a job.
doing what?
well, i don't mind getting up early, so i got a job throwing garbage... i'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
that's my father. i got to run.
hey, wait a minute. when am i going to see you again?
well, i know what my daddy's going to say.
what?
can i be honest?
sure.
well, that i shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
he'll say that?
yeah.
now what's he know about garbage, huh?
nothing.
there you go.
well, i mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... i've got to run.
you ever held another job before?
i used to throw trash for the city.
you lost that one?
wouldn't be here if i hadn't.
what kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
i can't think of anything at the moment... i'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving i came down here.
hi.
well, stop the world.
quit my job.
great.
just seemed like the right move... whatcha doing?
spanish.
how do you say "quit my job" in spanish?
something mi trabajo.
yeah, well, i'm going to work as a cowboy now... or thinking about it. it's a routine, like anything. what do you think?
i don't know.
you want to go for a ride?
well, i got homework.
bring it along.
you're a redhead.
i know.
anybody ever call you "red"?
yeah, but i don't like it.
why not?
just don't... i've got a headache.
yeah?
can i come around and see you tomorrow?
okay.
what a nice place.
yeah, the tree makes it nice.
and the flowers... let's not pick them. they're so nice.
it's your play.
my stomach's growling.
there's an old fudgesicle over there. you want it?
no.
somebody else is going to get it.
i don't care.
kids eat that kind of stuff in korea.
did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
yeah.
is that all there is to it?
yeah.
gosh, what was everybody talking about?
don't ask me.
you know what i think?
what?
that we should crunch our hands with this stone. that way we'd never forget what happened today.
but it would hurt.
well, that's the point, stupid.
don't call me stupid.
okay, but i'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
sure is pretty.
what'd you come out here for?
i wasn't aware there was any law against it.
you know, before i met her, nobody could ask me how i was doing with my girl. matter of fact, i didn't really have one.
is that right?
yeah.
listen. i got a lot of respect for her, sir.  that's about as good a one as i know to tell you.
well, it's not good enough.  just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, kit? guy like you.
she'd get along okay. and if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, i wouldn't mind... i'd always tell people i deserved it.
hi.
what're you doing?
i've got a gun here, sir. it's always a good idea to have one around.
what do you think you're doing? go on, get out of here.
well, i got it all planned... and i'm taking holly off with me.
what for?
for coming onto my property... with a gun.
no, you're not either.
yeah? why not?
cause i can't allow it.
i came in the front.
how bad off is he?
i can look and see.
we better call the doctor... listen. i'll say how it happened, part i saw.
well... i don't think that'd work.
are you sure?
you don't believe me, see for yourself.
listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
you said that once already... too late now.
why?
they're not going to listen to me. you either. are you kidding?
suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
wouldn't be funny... listen, i'll be back in a while.
how you doing?
i'm fine. kind of tired.
yeah, me too.
"the kon-tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. we had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. i thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
he was nervous.
how you doing, cato?
not bad.
what you been doing?
running this place for a fella in town. nothing much to speak of.
well, i don't notice us hustling trash, either.
where'd you get them antlers?
they come with the house.
yeah, i guess.
she plays the clarinet, too.
don't you ever get bored around here?
sometimes. the other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old spanish coins.
that's what he told you, huh?
no, he showed me one.
what'd they look like?
kind of round, like so... gold. i'll show you if you want.
kit... maybe i'd better get a shovel.
okay.
i'll catch up with you.
okay.
i found a lid. it was laying on the ground over there.
put that down. it's dirty.
look at all this junk.
how's he doing?
i got him in the stomach.
is he upset?
he didn't say anything to me about it.
whatcha looking in there for? we can't afford any of that.
just looking.
that your spider in there? in that bottle?
yeah.
what do you feed him?
oh, flies... grasshoppers when i can catch 'em.
does he bite?
he never bit me.
hi. where's cato?
well, he's gone.
gone?... where?
he said not to tell.
oh yeah?
yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. you're the ones with the studebaker, aren't you?
no... you go in there, i'll have to kill you.
what's going on?
can't afford to take chances.
nah, skip that... i'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
okay.
you don't mind?
what's going to happen to jack and me?
you have to ask kit. he says frog, i jump.
okay.
what's your friend's name?
jack.
you love him?
i don't know.
i've got to stick by kit... he feels trapped.
yeah. i can imagine.
well, i've felt that way, hadn't you?
you promise to stay down there for an hour?
yeah.
you expect me to believe that?
think i got 'em?
i don't know.
well, i'm not going down there and look.
what'd you put him in there for?
just to keep him out of the sun.
you tired?
yeah.
yeah, you look tired... listen, honey. when all this is over, i'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
i don't want a steak.
well, we'll see about that... hey, lookie.
later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
excuse me.
hi.
yes?
this your place?
yes.
sorry to barge in on you. anybody else here besides you two?
no.
good deal... oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. couple of hours, maybe. how'd that be?
stay as long as you like.
hi.
hi... ah, mister scarborough here?
yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. he's sick.
really?
yeah. i'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. don't want to start an epidemic.
no, of course not. it's only that he called last night and asked if i could come by.
well, he didn't have it last night.
what's that?
well, i'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
sure.
hi, whatcha doing?
just thinking.
good a way to kill time as any... she okay?
yes.
listen, ah... we're going to take the cadillac for a while. how'd that be?
fine.
don't worry, i won't let her drive.
you're my friend, aren't you?
yes.
okay, no monkey business then.
hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
well, why you always walking behind me?
don't.
anybody ever done that to you before?
no.
positive?
yes.
guess there's no way i'll ever know. for sure.
i'd like to get out of here.
soon as i start the car... and fix my hat.
"rumor: pat boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. fact: pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
i don't blame him.
"rumor: frank sinatra and rita hayworth are in love... fact: true, but not with each other."
that's montana over there.
i never been to montana... acquaintance of mine has, but i hadn't... never had any reason to.
why not? i mean, i'm having fun... at least i'm not bitching.
well, i feel kind of like an animal living out here. i mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
well, i'll catch you a big trout. soon as we get to the mountains.
everybody loves trout.
i'm serious.
maybe we should've tried to hop it.
it was going too fast.
i could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. i'm not saying that i know.
well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. we ought to find a more flat place.
how about over here?
never mind. it doesn't matter... if i'm worth a damn, i'll pick the right direction. and if i'm not, well, i don't care. see what i mean?
no.
well, i shouldn't expect miracles, should i?
what?
nothing... i was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
i'm sorry. i wasn't listening.
you know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
well. i'm not going to let that stop me.
you smoke pall mall?
yeah.
morning... say, you got any gas?
maybe.
well. i'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
see, we're about out... been driving all night. actually, i don't even have time to explain it to you.
well, matter of fact, i don't have any.
just a second now. that's your truck. isn't it?
you didn't walk out here.
it's mine all right.
well, listen. i'm going to swap you my cadillac.
who are you?
name is carruthers. believe i shoot people every now and then. not that i deserve a medal.
okay, friend. start running.
just gimme a chance.
git.
boy. i had a feeling today was going to be the day... helicopter.
yeah.
he's not coming to take us for a ride, either. come on, let's make a run for the car.
have you got a better idea?
i just don't want to go.
what?
hi.
hold it right there.
i could've held off an army if i could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
oh yeah?
long as my ammo held out... right there's where you caught me.
we did it, ray.
you better not leave that cadillac sitting out here.
think i'll take the juice?
beats me.
say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
thirty aught six.
you ever had to open it up like that before?
nope.
you tossed my hat out the window.
wanta sue me?
no.
kit... kit, i've got a question for you.
mmmmm.
you like people?
they're okay.
then why'd you do it?
i don't know. always wanted to be a criminal, i guess. just not this big a one... takes all kinds though.
hey, listen, tom, i don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. what do you say now?
i need to get your signature on some papers here, kit.
well, i've got to read them first. suppose i could get a coke while i do?
sure thing. come on.
holly's over here, kit, if you want to see her.
sure.
course it's too bad about your dad.
yeah.
we're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
well, kit...
tom...
good luck to you.
thanks.
i mean it.
i know you do. good luck to you, too.
