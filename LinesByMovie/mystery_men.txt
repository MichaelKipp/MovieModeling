he does not miss a trick, does he?
what a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
oh do not start that again --
look!
he is lance hunt! just take off the glasses -- and it is him!
there is a vague similarity.
a vague similarity? it is the same guy!
oh, who gives a damn who he is? i can not take this anymore. night after night we are on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
we take the licks and he gets the chicks.
how long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it is not going to happen?
we need a break, that is all! nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein!
but look at him... and look at us.
why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can not pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
i lost another fork tonight. she is getting suspicious, i know it.
so why do not you just tell her!
i can't.
why not?
because i can't! okay? she would not understand!
leave him alone. she is his mother, not yours.
we had an off night, that is all.
so when are we gonna have an on night?
you guys going to a costume party?
we are superheroes.
really? like captain amazing?
are you famous?
not yet.
so you are like... struggling superheroes?
we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... i am the blue raja, master of silverware...
wow.
and these are my associates, the shoveler.
hi.
and mister furious... his anger is his power.
really?
usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. in his case, it is entirely emotional.
so what can i get you?
burgers all around.  medium.  rare.  raw.
she likes you.
definitely.
ask her out.
nah.
roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
what does it matter? women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. they want to know why you are angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there is nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can not stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  and then they dump you.
so you are chicken?
who is chicken?
does not it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can not think of anything to say!
i guess... are you always so angry?
only when I am awake... you busy after work?
or talk?
not tonight.
maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
like what? cutting off my own ear?
or flowers.
see ya tomorrow.
jeffrey!
oh hi, mom.
what are you doing in the silver drawer?
looking for... the tv guide.
it is on the television.
of course. I am such a fool... thanks, mummy.
i hope you enjoy these cigars. i had to kill a dozen cubans to get them.
ummm.
have you considered my offer?
you know, mr. f, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. you had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you would snuff a babe. you were the king...
but times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. i can see you still got the style, but i dunno for sure you still got the edge.
i got it.
what about captain amazing?
i knew you would come. i left that skylight open for you.
i know you did.
i knew you would know.
i know you knew I would know.
but did you know i knew you would know I would know?
of course.
the jig is up, casanova. I have spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you are up to.
really?
i know that you are recruiting your old henchmen...
and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
i guess you know just about everything, do not you, lance?
um-hmm.
except for one little thing.
and what is that?
that I have hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
what --?
i saw him go in -- and he did not come out!
but we do not know for sure it is the same guy.
let's go.
wait!... look!
this is bad.
who are they?
the disco boys.
the who?
the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. twenty years ago they were casanova's personal bodyguard. but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
well they have crawled back out.
we may be getting in over our heads here.
this looks like a job for superman --
or batman --
or both.
everything's going exactly as we planned.
not quite. you have not announced our engagement yet.
it must have slipped my mind.
your mind is so slippery.
do not worry, pootchkie. my womanizing days are over. you are my lady macbeth, my imelda... my nicole.  we are such an incredible team. who could possibly stop us?
do not crunch the leaves.
sorry.
be a mohican.
I am soaked.  oh great.
shhh.
be a mohican.
shut up.
superheroes.
should i kill them?
why bother?
here you go.
ow.
maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero stuff and join kiwanis or something.
maybe she is right.
are you serious? this is the break we have been waiting for!
what are you talking about?
what have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
agents?
archenemies! casanova is not just a criminal -- he is a supervillain. stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
and it would be the right thing to do.
yeah yeah -- and that, too.
but there is only three of us, and he is got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
then maybe it is time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, disco boy bashing, warriors of the night!
I am liking this.
i say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
do we have to?
i got this cousin. he is a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
have you ever seen him?
how could i see him if he is invisible?
good point.
and there is the sphinx.
the who?
he is a legendary masked mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
sounds good.
no one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the tacky taco down by the bus station.
you sure that is how you spell it?
yeah.
so, let me get this straight. you have the power to become invisible.
yes.
but... only when no one is looking.
yes.
if someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
yes.
so you are only invisible... to yourself?
no.
so you are only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
yes.
so how do you know that you have ever been invisible?
i just know.
look, kid, we have got a lot of heroes to interview --
i know i have not got it entirely worked out yet, but I have always dreamed of becoming a superhero... were not you guys ever a kid? did not you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
there is just not enough of us.
but we know they are out there. hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
and a social life.
yeah, but how do we get to them?
maybe there was traffic.
who are we kidding? no one's going to show. we are living in a fantasy!
come on, guys -- we are fighting against evil.
good or evil, what is the difference?
there is a big difference.
i used to believe that. now I am not so sure.
roy, remember, it is all within your power. the only thing that is in your way... is you.
oh shut up.
who are you?
I am the bowler.
the bowler? i remember him from when i was a kid. he was killed years ago.
I am his daughter.
look, honey, being a superhero... it is a guy thing.
really?
hey... can i buy you a beer?
i thought you would never ask.
and then one day, he did not come home. the police said it was an accident. but cargo containers do not just fall on people. he was murdered... after that i fell apart. i dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. when my mother died i hit bottom... but then, when i was cleaning out her attic, i found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he would left them there for me... and i knew what i had to do.
so who killed him?
the disco boys.
you know something? those guys are really starting to piss me off!
but there is still only six of us.
so what?
that is two more than the fantastic four.
half a dirty dozen!
and you can not count horst buckholtz anyway.
he was cute though.
but they all had one thing we have not got.
how about... the savage six?
the inscrutable six?
the obliterators!
the eradicators!
what did you do with captain amazing?
captain who?
that boy's got talent.
and I am going to nip it in the bud.
to us!
whatever our name is.
but she is your mother. you got to tell her.
i can't.
I am her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. medicine. law.
but you are a superhero.
the cape. the turban. she would not understand.
i know... my girlfriends all dumped me after i put on the mask. they thought I would lost it.
but in fact... you would found it.
it is late. I am headin' home.
me, too.
come on, junior, it is a school night.
you are the sphinx.
and you are a fool.
so what else has superman got?
he is got the fact that he is superman!
firepower costs money.
anybody got any?
we did not think this through very well.
my father had this friend... he was an inventor...
are you sure he is still lives here?
are you sure he is still alive?
he was the last time i saw him.
when was that?
i was eight.
yes!
doctor heller?
yes!
it is me... elizabeth.
elizabeth! little elizabeth! why you are so... middle aged!
thanks.
how is your dad?
he is dead.
oh that is right -- they squished him... heck of a guy.
doc, these are my friends. we are superheroes, and we need your help.
well, i give to the united way, and i feel that sort of covers --
but, doc... where is the machine guns?
the bazookas?
twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and casanova was their king.
crime was rampant. it was not safe to stay in your home.
much less go outside.
then captain amazing appeared.
he busted casanova and sent the crooks packing.
and this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
but now casanova's back! and we are going to sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
the wise snake coils before he strikes.
and a skunk stinks!
you drink too much.
when are you going to take off that mask?
when i am sure i am among friends.
roy --
go dance with your mother, jeffrey!
your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
my heart died a long time ago.
it is not dead. it is hiding.
blow it out your bean hole, pancho!... and to hell with the rest of you!... look at you. bunch of rejects. i did not need you before -- and i do not need you now!  the great ones ride alone!  adios, muchachos!
hi.
alone tonight?
every night.
monica... i was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- i mean you and i -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- i mean have a...
date?
yeah.
i get off work in fifteen minutes. walk me home?
sure.
that was easy.
where are you going?
head hunting.
i admire you.
why?
being a superhero, wanting to save the world. it is so... unselfish.
it is?
most people just want to make money or be famous or something. but you risk everything, just to help people.
i would not mind being famous.
who wouldn't?
I have never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why i guess I am still a waitress.
nothing wrong with being a waitress.
what is your real name?
roy.
have you always lived here?
me too... i love this stupid old town. it is noisy. it is smelly. it is falling apart.
it is home.
yeah.
I have thought of leaving, going to chicago or new york, but...
what have they got that we am not got?
champion's going to bounce back, and i want to be here when it does.
me, too.
you do not seem very angry right now.
you know what? underneath all that anger i think there is just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
i just want to be a superhero.
that is what i mean... 'night, roy.
I will let you in on a little secret, roy. in two days this entire city will belong to me, and there is not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. it is the perfect time to switch teams... so what do you say?
you are nuts.
they always call the great ones nuts.
and the nuts always call themselves great.
are you with me... or against me?
against.
too bad. plug him!
thanks for reminding me which team I am on.
you are dead.
so are you!
casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there was not a thing that we could do about it.
what did he mean?
i dunno.
maybe it is time we checked that place out.
but how do we get in?
so where is the art?
he has not stolen it yet.
this place is built like a fortress.
because that is what it is.
what is that?
come on.
i hope you will not take this the wrong way, but i could not help but notice... that you are a dead ringer for veronica lake in "the blue dahlia".
really?
are you an actress?
just a waitress.
you underestimate yourself.
you know I am writing a play -- it is just a little broadway thing, but there is a part in it that i think you would be perfect for.
really?
I would love to hear you read it. could you stick around after the luncheon?
sure -- i guess.
terrific.
that was too close.
but we got to find out what is going on in there.
no one will believe us.
they will think we are just a bunch of weirdoes.
we are outnumbered twenty to one.
it is suicide.
maybe. but this is not about living or dying. it is about good versus evil, and we are good, whether we like it or not... maybe we look a little funny...
and smell a little funny. we are not bulletproof and we can not fly. but we are superheroes -- and that means doing what is right -- even when it is impossible... this is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we do not save them, nobody will! so i say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they will never forget!
now you are talking.
sounds good to me.
let's do it.
we could really use some coffee --
and some sandwiches --
but that place is huge and we do not know where this psycho thing is --
or even what it looks like.
jeffrey, you thief!
mother... it is not what you think!
and why are you wearing that silly costume?
because... I am a superhero!
oh, mother, I am sorry. i know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it is just not who i am!
but... the silverware?
i use it... to fight evil.
jeffrey... this is wonderful.
it is?
i always knew that you were special.
you did?
ever since you were a little boy...  come with me.
mon captain, it is for you.
hello?
it is me.
monica, where are you?
at the frankenstein center.
are you nuts? get out of there!
I am going inside.
what are you talking about?
listen, casanova may be a supervillain, but he is got a weakness, and I am it. maybe -- just maybe -- i can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
he is a psycho! he will kill you!
just shut up and listen. hold off the attack as long as you can. if i can discover the location I will call you --
and what if you get killed?
then at least i will have died trying, right?
roy... we might never see each other again, so I would better tell you now... i think you are wonderful.
what?
bye.
monica!
hey... you okay?
sure.
hi.
i thought you would chickened out on me.
just wanted to... powder my nose.
how 'bout giving me "the tour"?
why not?
who is the artist?
me.
we are all the same really. our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever.
he is in love. his anger is gone.
oh no.
great timing!
snap out of it!
get on to yourself!
get mad!
but i just do not feel it.
he is turned into a completely normal person!
normal. what is normal? does normal exist? and if it did, how would we know it?
your spiderman pez dispenser!
okay, you win. I am pissed off. I am seriously peeved.
come here.
I am not that kind of girl.
then why are you here?
curiosity.
remember the cat.
what are you doing all alone in the dark?
fantasizing... about you.
i thought you were done?
one last tweak.
it is time.
with or without him, we gotta go!
our guests are waiting.
I will be down in a jiffy.
I would better go.
you are a spy.
what?
i saw him walk you home.
who?
roy.
stay away!
or you will what? can me?
but she still might call!
are you coming or not?
I will drive.
not a chance!
we have got lift off!
may the forks be with us!
come on, baby!
do it, big boy!
atta, girl!
atta, boy!
where am i going?
through there!
right.
cover me!
with what?
he will never make it.
think positive.
you two timing psychotic bastard.
darling, you have got the wrong idea.
do i?
i was only strangling her... I have killed hundreds of women. it does not mean a thing.  pootchkie, you are over-reacting. this is our night. it is what we have lied for... cheated for... murdered for. she is just a plaything, a trifle... you are the only woman who is ever meant anything to me. i adore you. i worship you. i want to make you my bride.
and the light goes out...
frankenstein!
let me guess... bullets do not hurt you.
they hurt... but they do not stop me!
hey, do i look like a man?
well we can not call ourselves the mystery people.
eat your mustard.
it does not matter what we call ourselves. we know who we are.
yes, obie-wan.
hey... he is gone.
