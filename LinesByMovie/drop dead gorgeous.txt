do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
oh yah-sure, i know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
...that filth is better left in the "sin cities."
a.k.a. minneapolis -- st. paul.
...today's "to do" list includes a trip to the mall of america. we need outfits for the "physical fitness" number --
nothin' too showy!
y'betcha, iris. we still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
gladys -- gladys! look out!
oh, my!  hello, father donigan! sidewalks, sidewalks?
iris, stop!  it's not his fault. the communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
that's why we lutherans use grape koolaid for the blood of christ.
oh, there's a parking space over there. oh, no, that's just a compact. sorry.
you'd think they'd build the parking lot of america to go with the mall of america!
it's a two-hundred dollar fine!
i said i'd move if a cripple came. let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
all right, let's go.
oh! what is it?
"proud... to be... an... american."
so what was the theme of the pageant last year?
last year? it was, "buy american."
and the year before that?
"u.s.a. is a-okay."
can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
"can i? i'm amer-i-can!" people ask me where i get this. i don't know, it's... maybe a gift from god or somethin'.
i'm lucky i have an after-school job where i can practice my talent.
oh, yeah, sure. you know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. when i was seventeen, i don't know if you know this, but i was crowned mount rose's american teen princess. and this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, rebecca ann leeman is competin'.
excuse me, father, mother, when are we moving back to tokyo? i can't stand this place anymore. they put butter on everything.
english! english, you stupid little retard! we america now, tina!
i'm sorry, dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "tina," it's seiko.
tina! tina!! tina!!!
mom, i just finished the third movement of that concerto i was working on. i put, like, this techno beat on this japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
no! we not like to hear it! go to your room and shut up!
oh, i almost forgot...  i got my acceptance to tokyo university.
what, you deaf? i say shut up -- shut up -- shut up!  cut her outta this!
well, you know, i think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
it's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. it's just so odd and gross.
you know that sometimes it's hard to understand god's great plan.
yeah.
...oh, yeah-right. i ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
tammy curry?
yah -- yah. everyone says this is a big accident? she got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
this pageant's like a roach motel.
girls check in, but they don't check out.
yeah. and they say smokin' is bad for your health.
yeah.
what're you doin' here?
oh, amber, like you're the only one who visits mary.
...yah -- 1963. her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in louisville, her hometown. those were different times.
hey, amber, y'get my smokes?
that's my mom.  i'll get 'em in a sec.
oh shit!
they're from l.a. they wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
oh... how quickly they grow up.  hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
...you betcha. s'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
oh, lester. he loves his weather, y'know.
hey, ya like it? open it... yah -- the globe. pull at the equator there.
we're not in the showroom, dear.
lester?
oh, all right  how soon they forget where all this comes from.
yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
sammy davis, jr., honey.
yeah, yeah, the jew.
are we on "cops?" are we on "cops?" are we on "cops?"
shut up, hank. this here's business.
ow, harold -- mom said not the head.
well, mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
i will if you shut your piehole.
don't make me kick-ya where the good lord split-ya.
hi...
hi.
here, i'll take it. it's my job.
no...  it's all right. i got it. don't worry about it.
oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
then it must be wednesday.
so, uh, i -- i'm not really busy friday. i just said that -- y'know.
i know.
so if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
well, uh, i'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe i could call you tonight.
yah-sure, fine... fine.
okay... well, bye.
bye.
what do you mean, they take out her butt?
oh, jesus h. christ!
are we on "cops" again?
you could be quiet.
hi.
hi.
it's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. i told you about 'em.
oh, naw. hi.
this here's loretta.
i tell annette, i says, "you talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  you guys want a beer?
say, yous boys been to the leeman's?
loretta, shut it.
y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
shut it up, loretta.
oh, christ, it's true.
let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is amber.
why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, loretta.
she's the prettiest, y'know. the best damn tapper. the most smartest...
"most smartest?" oh, that's good, loretta. make sure you get a picture of that. "most smartest." we're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
well, excuse me, annette, but i'm braggin' up your kid, here.  amber's gonna be the next diane sawyer, y'know...
i'll be right back. see ya later.
they're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
all right, they're makin' a movie.
you don't know where this is gonna...
i got a hairdo.
don't fall for it. she lives two trailers down.
so? be real easy.
go on home, loretta. come on. go on, the party's over.
anyone?
sorry. i just thought she might not wanna meet her maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  the clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. pink cheeks, and...
-- red nose and ears. i know, i know.
amber...
no, don't say it. another stray bullet to the head.
i'm gonna need more caps.
you hafta go home. there's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
relax, that's my ma's code for, "bring home milk and a carton-a luckys."
no. loretta called. there's been a... a fire.
is mom okay?
she's alive, sweetie.
where is she?!
she's right over there.
mommmm! i'll be right behind you in the hearse!
don't let that worry you, annette!
oh, mom, it's so ugly.
ruined a brand-new pair of lee press- ons.  well, i sat down for a beer and ka- blewey! next thing i know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. next thing i know, i'm ass up in loretta's flower bed.
oh-jesus-mary-n-joseph, she's pregnant!  if you are -- come back, sweetie. mommy wants to talk, then kill you!
annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
you're what?!
i -- i'm quittin' the pageant.
i heard you, i was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. oh for chrissakes, amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a goddamn lawn dart!
oh god, i'm dead...
so, what do i say?
simple. just say, "mom, i know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. all so i could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. but, y'know what? i'm quittin'." there. easy as pie.
oh my god. i'm so dead...
yeah, you betcha...
go on! get out!
mom, look, don't say anything. first of all, i'm not pregnant.
mom!
i ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. i'm reaching' a point where i'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
okay. yesterday i... i got this picture. so i kinda, y'know, i'm thinkin' no. i'm gonna, i -- i -- i'm gonna quit the pageant.
what?!
ow!
would yous boys excuse us a second? loretta, you too.
nice mouth you got there, mom, but i -- i'm not goin' through this again.
you're not goin' through this again? you? you're not the one who knows how jiffy pop feels.
oh, c'mon... first the picture of tammy, then brett clemens, now this? it's scary.
let me tell you "scary," amber. look at me. do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? i'm a "lifer" here. best i can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
that's it, i'm goin'...
honest to god, if i got to do it over? i'd start walkin' outta this town the minute i took my first step. practically the only thing i wouldn't do different is have you...
god i hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
it's me... i just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. this pageant's your ticket outta here. i know you can win, amber.
c'mere. i love you so much.
i love you much.
hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
no. mom said if i did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
"once a carnie, always a carnie."
oh-yah.
so, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
okay, everybody, listen up!
number one, american teen princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
close up shop. close up shop, hank.
harold!
close up shop!
that was your mom. she wanted you to have this.
really, loretta?
you-betcha.
my mom wanted me to have this?
oh, shut up. i thought it might help you get some sleep.
loretta, never have kids.
well god-love-ya for thinkin' i still could.
okay, okay!  listen-up. coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  number one, gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "physical fitness" routine...
oh my god! my -- my tap costume's gone.
uh, amber? we're not puttin' on our talent costumes. you need to put on your "physical fitness" outfit. and let's shake a leg, ladies.
no, wait. it -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. what am i sayin'? i should just ask you, becky. where is it?
what?
you heard me. where is it?
if you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
i just did.
well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, becky -- bring it on.
well, as my mother says at sunday dinner, "come and get it," bitch!
oh, i'll "get it." i'll "get it" all right. i might even take seconds.
if you want seconds, then i'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
bitch!
i hate her!
we all do. now let's go.
here, i didn't get any.
here, have some.
mrs. clark, why are you doing this to me? why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
amber, i'm sorry. i really am. but you know the rules. all talent costumes hafta be okay'd by gladys before the pageant.
but, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
sorry. i -- i don't make the rules.
this, this... this is bullshit!
amber atkins! that is not american teen princess language!
good, 'cause this isn't an american teen princess pageant -- it's, it's nazi germany!
mrs. leeman?
huh?
i -- i'm wearin' this costume. i'm, uh, i'm gonna do my talent tonight.
oh really -- i don't think so.  uh, amber, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. and this...  this is why we have the rule. my goodness gracious, i couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. we have kids in the audience.
but, you -- i mean... it's not my fault. i -- i... please? i didn't do anything wrong...
oh, amber...
i -- i -- i -- i -- i --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
i can't believe this is happenin'. i can't believe she said you couldn't...
amber? here.
"here," wh-wh-what?
my jacket. take it 'cause, y'know, i got my costume okay'd before the pageant. you can wear it.
shut up, yous guys. look, amber, i'm not gonna win. and let's be honest, a family only needs one "liza" and you know peter's got much better legs than me.
your parents'd kill you.
oh c'mon, i love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause peter needed a kidney.
lis, i want to, i really do, but... oh, i can't.
then do it for peter. mrs. leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. he'd pop his nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, i don't know, got her back.
yah?
oh-you-beccha.
ee-aaayeeee-aaaayouiaaaeeeeeeee!
come on! hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
so, anyone talk to janelle?
yah -- i brought her some flowers this morning. she's in the room next to my mom. she's super happy.
we was robbed.
okay. take her purse.
bye mom.
we was robbed.
it's okay.
oh, mom's okay. they're just givin' her a ride back. she almost blew outta the back of loretta's pick-up on the way over.
thank god for bunge cords.
...yah -- well, at least, y'know, i got to perform. and mom got to see me.  i guess number eight only worked for diane sawyer...
well, it's all happenin' so fast. goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? i mean, i won! i'm the winner! i'm going to state!
she's the winner and we're going to state.
what a surprise. gladys leeman's finally gonna go to state. and she'll probably ride on becky's ass all the way to nationals, too.
i wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
hey! turn that float around. you think a swan's gonna swim ass first up main street?
yah -- gladys had me order that swan special made from mexico  in case becky won. i do a lotta business with those people. i always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  whoo, they love that.
let's get this straight right now. we wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
i want to have the big bag of little donuts.
you get nothing, hank, okay?
i want to get the big bag of little donuts.
there's your paint can. the next time you drink window cleaner, i'm just gonna leave it in ya.
c'mon, rebecca, you wanted it. now get up there. ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. c'mon, now.
it smells funny. like gasoline.
oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in mexico.
my dress'll reek.
listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
amber, if i die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
yeah...
and the bite marks on my ears?
yes...
i know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
yes, leslie!
okay, i designed the float, you know. and, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
uh, gladys?
what!
we need more bars!
this is -- what?
enid ate a whole pan!
i swear to god she can't do anything by herself.
hey, ted, sorry. i didn't know your family was in the garage when i set it on fire!
gladys! stop it!
guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. ah- hahahahahahahaha!
so help me, gladys.
becky was my only shot at state!
that's enough!
let go! let go of me. oh my god, it's cops!
what is wrong with you?
i don't know. i just didn't wanna win like this.
you stop right there. you are a good person. good things happen to good people.
really?
no. it's pure bullshit, sweetie. you're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. let's get you a root beer float.
okay.
do you guys want some shots? i'm buyin'.
i never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. the whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
this came for you, sweetie.
ah! it's from state! oh my god!
it's all the stuff i get to do. oh my god, oh my god... okay, okay... we get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- eeeh! okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- no way. oh... my... god!
what? for chrissakes, spit it out.
i'll be stayin' overnight at... the airport howard johnsons!
right by the airport -- oh, amber...
there's an indoor swimming pool! ahhhh!
all right, say "airport ho-jo."
airport ho-jo!
i got it! yeah, why don't ya take a...
loretta, don't do that.
i'm sorry. they're just starin'.
i gotta work with these women.
okay, sweetie, that's all right. let's go. let's go.
i'm a mirror.
correction. this spunky monkey on my right is terry macey. and we are your minnesota american teen princess state board.
we're also the co-founders of the minnesota modeling academy. applications are at the tiki bar. we'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
that's right.
okay?
mm-hm.
people, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- iowa, wisconsin, north dakota...
yeah.
dakota.
ohio...
that bitch from...
what?
wisconsin.
all right, then.
the bitch.
the important thing is that we have a winner...
i just, i just can't believe it. i'm minnesota's american teen princess!
our baby's going to nationals! lincoln, alabama -- look out!
i'm gonna be on tv! just like diane sawyer.
annette, just use your hand.
they told me to practice.
do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
oh yah-sure, i know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --

let me tell you "scary," amber. look at me. do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? i'm a "lifer" here. best i can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
that's it, i'm goin'...
honest to god, if i got to do it over? i'd start walkin' outta this town the minute i took my first step. practically the only thing i wouldn't do different is have you...
god i hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
it's me... i just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. this pageant's your ticket outta here. i know you can win, amber.
c'mere. i love you so much.
i love you much.
hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
no. mom said if i did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
"once a carnie, always a carnie."
oh-yah.
so, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
okay, everybody, listen up!
number one, american teen princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
close up shop. close up shop, hank.
harold!
close up shop!
that was your mom. she wanted you to have this.
really, loretta?
you-betcha.
my mom wanted me to have this?
oh, shut up. i thought it might help you get some sleep.
loretta, never have kids.
well god-love-ya for thinkin' i still could.
okay, okay!  listen-up. coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  number one, gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "physical fitness" routine...
oh my god! my -- my tap costume's gone.
uh, amber? we're not puttin' on our talent costumes. you need to put on your "physical fitness" outfit. and let's shake a leg, ladies.
no, wait. it -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. what am i sayin'? i should just ask you, becky. where is it?
what?
you heard me. where is it?
if you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
i just did.
well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, becky -- bring it on.
well, as my mother says at sunday dinner, "come and get it," bitch!
oh, i'll "get it." i'll "get it" all right. i might even take seconds.
if you want seconds, then i'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
bitch!
i hate her!
we all do. now let's go.
here, i didn't get any.
here, have some.
mrs. clark, why are you doing this to me? why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
amber, i'm sorry. i really am. but you know the rules. all talent costumes hafta be okay'd by gladys before the pageant.
but, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
sorry. i -- i don't make the rules.
this, this... this is bullshit!
amber atkins! that is not american teen princess language!
good, 'cause this isn't an american teen princess pageant -- it's, it's nazi germany!
mrs. leeman?
huh?
i -- i'm wearin' this costume. i'm, uh, i'm gonna do my talent tonight.
oh really -- i don't think so.  uh, amber, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. and this...  this is why we have the rule. my goodness gracious, i couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. we have kids in the audience.
but, you -- i mean... it's not my fault. i -- i... please? i didn't do anything wrong...
oh, amber...
i -- i -- i -- i -- i --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
i can't believe this is happenin'. i can't believe she said you couldn't...
amber? here.
"here," wh-wh-what?
my jacket. take it 'cause, y'know, i got my costume okay'd before the pageant. you can wear it.
shut up, yous guys. look, amber, i'm not gonna win. and let's be honest, a family only needs one "liza" and you know peter's got much better legs than me.
your parents'd kill you.
oh c'mon, i love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause peter needed a kidney.
lis, i want to, i really do, but... oh, i can't.
then do it for peter. mrs. leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. he'd pop his nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, i don't know, got her back.
yah?
oh-you-beccha.
ee-aaayeeee-aaaayouiaaaeeeeeeee!
come on! hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
so, anyone talk to janelle?
yah -- i brought her some flowers this morning. she's in the room next to my mom. she's super happy.
we was robbed.
okay. take her purse.
bye mom.
we was robbed.
it's okay.
oh, mom's okay. they're just givin' her a ride back. she almost blew outta the back of loretta's pick-up on the way over.
thank god for bunge cords.
...yah -- well, at least, y'know, i got to perform. and mom got to see me.  i guess number eight only worked for diane sawyer...
well, it's all happenin' so fast. goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? i mean, i won! i'm the winner! i'm going to state!
she's the winner and we're going to state.
what a surprise. gladys leeman's finally gonna go to state. and she'll probably ride on becky's ass all the way to nationals, too.
i wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
hey! turn that float around. you think a swan's gonna swim ass first up main street?
yah -- gladys had me order that swan special made from mexico  in case becky won. i do a lotta business with those people. i always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  whoo, they love that.
let's get this straight right now. we wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
i want to have the big bag of little donuts.
you get nothing, hank, okay?
i want to get the big bag of little donuts.
there's your paint can. the next time you drink window cleaner, i'm just gonna leave it in ya.
c'mon, rebecca, you wanted it. now get up there. ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. c'mon, now.
it smells funny. like gasoline.
oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in mexico.
my dress'll reek.
listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
amber, if i die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
yeah...
and the bite marks on my ears?
yes...
i know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
yes, leslie!
okay, i designed the float, you know. and, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
uh, gladys?
what!
we need more bars!
this is -- what?
enid ate a whole pan!
i swear to god she can't do anything by herself.
hey, ted, sorry. i didn't know your family was in the garage when i set it on fire!
gladys! stop it!
guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. ah- hahahahahahahaha!
so help me, gladys.
becky was my only shot at state!
that's enough!
let go! let go of me. oh my god, it's cops!
what is wrong with you?
i don't know. i just didn't wanna win like this.
you stop right there. you are a good person. good things happen to good people.
really?
no. it's pure bullshit, sweetie. you're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. let's get you a root beer float.
okay.
do you guys want some shots? i'm buyin'.
i never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. the whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
this came for you, sweetie.
ah! it's from state! oh my god!
it's all the stuff i get to do. oh my god, oh my god... okay, okay... we get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- eeeh! okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- no way. oh... my... god!
what? for chrissakes, spit it out.
i'll be stayin' overnight at... the airport howard johnsons!
right by the airport -- oh, amber...
there's an indoor swimming pool! ahhhh!
all right, say "airport ho-jo."
airport ho-jo!
i got it! yeah, why don't ya take a...
loretta, don't do that.
i'm sorry. they're just starin'.
i gotta work with these women.
okay, sweetie, that's all right. let's go. let's go.
i'm a mirror.
correction. this spunky monkey on my right is terry macey. and we are your minnesota american teen princess state board.
we're also the co-founders of the minnesota modeling academy. applications are at the tiki bar. we'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
that's right.
okay?
mm-hm.
people, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- iowa, wisconsin, north dakota...
yeah.
dakota.
ohio...
that bitch from...
what?
wisconsin.
all right, then.
the bitch.
the important thing is that we have a winner...
i just, i just can't believe it. i'm minnesota's american teen princess!
our baby's going to nationals! lincoln, alabama -- look out!
i'm gonna be on tv! just like diane sawyer.
annette, just use your hand.
they told me to practice.
