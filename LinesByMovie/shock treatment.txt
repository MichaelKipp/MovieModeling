you'll find a rambling rose and a picket fence
tenderness and innocence in denton`
in a way...
i detect a note of reticence. are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
well, betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
let's hear the five 'f's' for today.  f for...
farley!
f for...
flavors!
f for...
fabulous!
f for...
fast!
f for...
foods!
thank you so much, judge wright, for another wonderful interview.
judge wright?  now, betty? first name terms, surely!
oh, oliver, you're so tolerant. time for a coffee before you rush off?
delighted, betty -- that is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
why, oliver, since ralph and i separated maturity is something i look for in a man.
a free thinker.
everything's free there.
you bet, bert.
good!  i'm gonna be there.
macy struthers -- god i must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
isn't that brad and janet majors sitting down front?  what an ideal couple.
that's us.
i don't want to get up there.
we've got to, brad, everyone's watching.
introduce yourselves.
i'm janet majors and this is my husband brad.
we've been hearing some bad things about you, brad.
he needs help.
i know, i know, it's just...
looks like 'rest home' for this marriage.
do you watch 'dentonvale,' janet?
i've caught it once or twice.
of course!  d.t.v.'s most popular hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, cosmo and nation mckinley. neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my french. i recommend you send brad to them for treatment!
i know he's boring but... neuro-specialists!  that sounds pretty drastic.
it's no use pussyfooting around, janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
mckinley?...mckinley?
bert brought them over from europe.  they had a very popular series together.  it's still rerun in a lot of countries.  you must have seen them in 'dentonvale?'
i'm not going, janet.
what are you trying to do?  make bert look like a fool?  he's made all the arrangements.
but i don't need treadment.
ah.  mr. and mrs. majors.  how wonderful to see you.  i am dr. cosmo mckinley and this is my sister, and colleague, nation mckinley.
we understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
no!  he's never done that before.
good!  well there's still hope. lots of hope.
could i do that later?
of course.
just one or two details.  does he have any living relatives? blood relatives?
no...couldn't i do this later?
about brad's family?
as janet's parents this should be really easy.  your last clue... mental instability.  you have thirty seconds.
mental instability?
he was adopted you know.
i'd forgotten.
well i hadn't.  i was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  i said to janet 'what do we know of his parents?'
you got it!
i got it!  i got it!!!
congratulations!  it's 'happy homes' for harry and emily weiss of denton.
oh my poor baby.
oh.  mom.  it's brad.
i know.
they call it a new look at an old favourite i copied it from the 'window on the world' show.  the far east meets the mid-west!
it's...
just what the doctor ordered.  i know.  come on in, my favourite show's just started.
what show?
infantile regression.
you got it!
i got it!  i got it!!!
our speciality.
i can't wait to begin on him. really, bert, i don't know what we'd do without you!
of course, mrs. majors -- janet -- but i'm puzzled.  if she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
no it wasn't janet -- exactly -- it was, in fact, your new sponsor.
sponsor!!!
dentonvale has been sold.
sold??!!
dear old bert's settled everything.
jah -- you endorse his product -- he endorses your research.
he!!??  how dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
i don't think he intends to go that far.
poor brad.
thank god he was born an orphan. it would have killed his parents.
what are you talking about? danny slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  i played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  and hank says danny's moved to new york.  to better himself.
he moved all right!  when they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of wilson's bakery.
you shouldn't have said that.
why?
your father doesn't like mexicans.
hey!  what are you trying to do?  get yourself committed?
i'm sorry, officer.
vance!  vance parker.
janet.  janet majors.  it's just that brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  i don't want to miss the next episode of dentonvale.
dentonvale...say, that's for...  i'm sorry to hear that, janet.  look i'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
thanks officer park...vance.
don't worry, janet.  brad'll probably get just what he needs.
conspiracy?  that sounds a little farfetched.
it's happened before.  remember lieutenant orpheus?  he disappeared into that underworld series and never came back.
sounds like my husband.  he never came back either.  at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break.
ah yes.  farley flavors.  you know, i find it...
oh.  ah, i'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am i?
not at all.  you have your life.  and i have mine.
yeah, well.  here, betty.  i just came to give you this.
i'll leave you young things to it.
shove it, ralph!
you too, betty!
conspiracy is right.  the denton dossier is...
...closed?
with fast food farley at the helm it'll be tv dinners from now on.
farley is already a tv winner as we shall see.  dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
our field.
what does he know about it?
we're the experts.
who trusts experts?
how did you come by this scenario?
i am in farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
why janet?
everyone loves the girl next door, particularly farley.
so it seems.
it's you we're concerned about, janet.
yes how are you, janet?  are you happy?
i'm...happy.
there are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
but they only think they're happy.
that doesn't make sense.
i won't be a party to this.  i want to see brad.
the question is, does brad want to see you?  quite frankly, he hates you.
what do you mean?
brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
me?
it's classical.  almost a textbook case...
that's an extremely negative response.
yes, janet.  leave the crying to brad.
is it because i'm becoming too popular?
on the contrary.  he wants to see your ratings soar.  he needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
i bet that macy struthers had a hand in this.  we'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
now betty, don't overreact.
overreact!  you're the one with theories about conspirac...  oliver?
yes, betty.
are you spoken for this evening?
right!  an early start with janet's debut on 'good morning denton.' by the time we unveil farley's 'faith factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
can i just 'peep in' on brad before i go home?
home?
this is the nerve center of operations, janet.  you must stay here tonight.  that way we can all be here when mr. sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
and you can 'peep in' on brad in the morning.
clever of you to find this spot, betty.
it pays to know your way around, oliver.
a 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
oh i adore coleridge taylor.  as a matter of fact...
i feel the heat from your skin and the stubble on your chin you're no good
you're no good
you've got dirt on your hands and everybody understands you're no good
you're no good
what a joke...
what a joke...
you fel like choking you play for broke...
you play for broke...
he leaves you smoking...
oh romance is not a children's game...
you keep going back it's driving you insane
night night
night night
it's time for bye-byes it's been a great day thanks a heap now it's time for everyone to go to sleep
when do i get to see brad?
after breakfast.  you're sounding tense, janet.  maybe i could give you a little massage?
in my time they used to call me the merlin of berlin.
they probably meant irving and wanted you to swing.
i want to see brad.
i understand your concern, but i feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  look at yourself.
is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
absolutely true.  compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
you are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
if only brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
he will.  but it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  you've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  and farley's given you that chance.  you can use the breakfast show to knock denton dead.
do you really think so?
you've got a really tight team around you.  and everybody needs you!
but what'll i do?  what'll i say?  what'll i wear?
ever since i was a little boy dressing up has always been my greatest joy but when it's time to be discreet there's one thing you just can't beat that's a strapless, backless classical little black
but...how?
well first you go rip rip rip then you go snip snip snip then you whip in a zip zip zip an' you split it up to the hip hip hip an' as you strip strip strip you quiver and shiver for that soft caress as you slip slip slip...into that little black dress
that minimal
criminal
sin-i-ful
little black dress
criminal
sin-i-ful
out of self comes selflessness.
show yourself.  the real you. the secret you.
i've just come to tell you how fabulous i am.
janet!  where's that lovely dress i made you?
oh, mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
you're practically naked!
i can't wear anything under it. that would spoil the line.
. . .for his own good.
of course.  he was in great danger of harming himself.
and none of them worked?
no.
and we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
we're not confused.
look.  look at that.  bert schnick can see.  why...he's...dancing.
yes.  macabre, isn't it.  the blind leading the blind.
hi!  macy struthers -- co-host on the f. f. show.
ah, macy.  why don't you help janet freshen up before rehearsal.
surely.
later, brenda.  ah, bert, could you spare a moment?
of course.
how's brad?
a wreck.
check.  the quacks are willing tools?
fools!
i wouldn't mind doing janet one or two favours.
time to check with flavors.
it's only one night, janet. let's not forget who we're doing this for?
who?
brad!
i'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  i've got a lot going for me.  i'm going places.  i'm going to be someone.  i'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if i have to kill to do it.  i'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. i don't even know why i'm wasting my time here with you.  i should be with my people...
so all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
...and an attractive financial prospect for denton.
did you /hear/ that, oliver.
yes, betty.  but the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
oh, oliver.  what are we going to do?
no!  i don't know what janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
care to indulge?
indulge?
in a little masquerade?
oh, harry.  what are we going to do?
well...maybe i could wear my black leather brogues?
too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
i'm looking for love
i'm looking for trade
but without you and me, sis  the world'd fall to pieces  vena cava who's the raver?
our raving saviour that's you!!
i need some
young blood
i need some
young blood
i need it now i need some
young blood
i need some
young blood
betty, it's imperative we get janet out of flavors' fast fingers and brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. if only i could place that name -- mckinley?
he was a president.
president?  past presidents! betty, this is beginning to add up.
really.  what'll i pin this on?
faith, betty.  but make sure it's your own.
like a virgin with an' urgin' in a surgery i'll be swinging -- i'll be bringing out the nurse in me
the art will start when i play my part as the healer who will steal your heart
this could be the start of a whole new career here
like a deep plum lipstick and some therapeutics
this could take us to a town that's nowhere near here
got the hot flush symptoms and i'm feeling freaky
young male intern, tall and handsome
got my hem so high they'll say i'm being cheeky
with legs like mine i'm really made for dancing
brad!  oh, brad.
he's a lame dog, remember?  but even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
breaking out
breaking out
breaking out
breaking out
breaking out
breaking out
mr.  flavors -- may i have a moment of your time?
sure thing.
we've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  is this true?
absolutely correct.
could you tell us a little about it?
let's just say that i'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
and how does *'local girl'* janet majors fit into the scheme of things?
isn't she lovely?
mommy and daddy love you, baby.
she walks in beauty...
we love you, baby.
we all love janet...who do we love?
sank you!  velcome!  sank you!
what's cookin', bert?
i tell you what's cooking.  she made the blind see and it was a gift!  who was it from?  let's hear an 'f" for...
brad!
arrest that man!  he's committed to our care.
i never signed the contract.  he's not going anywhere.
i've took as much of you as any man can you've lost your heart
you've lost your cause
you lost your baby when you lost your balls you've lost your mind, you've lost your grip so say bye-bye
an' you're a weeper and a wailer always treading the toes of the great generally spreading your weight you're a spiteful, hateful asinine creature a pupil with no scruples who knew better than the teacher
i've took as much of you as any man can
you've lost your heart
you've lost your cause
you lost your baby when you lost your balls you've lost your mind, you've lost your grip so say bye-bye
they should be sent to the danube before dawn.
what?
nothing.  just...memories!
this could be worse than the old series.
in the old series we didn't have a convertible.
